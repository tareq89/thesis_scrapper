15   :   Place: Lailaty
Order: Falooda 100/-

Review:
I love Falooda with sweet yoghurt in it, Star's is undoubtedly one of the best to suit my taste. But after dinner at Lailaty, I was craving something sweet and the Falooda in the menu was calling to me! Falooda it was. 

And my, was it a Lovely Surprise or what to find they do it with sweet yoghurt too!! Yum Yum! It looked mouthwatering when It came to our table and all that Jelly and Tapioca was blinging at me. The first spoonful was pure delight, although a word of warning, that yoghurt is Ah-Mazingly Thick and Creamy and Thick! It was a perfect blend of Sweet Yoghurt, Fleshy Grapes, Creamy Jelly and Tapioca! There was banana in it too, unfortunately for me. It was a Good Falooda although still not as good as Star and a little less sweet, especially at the bottom. 

Don't eat up all the Yoghurt at first go though, Mix it well in scoops that go all the way to the bottom and you won't be left slurping watery Tapioca in the Last Bite lol! But I'm still going to Star next time.

115   :   Place: Lailaty
Order: Falooda 100/-

Review:
I love Falooda with sweet yoghurt in it, Star's is undoubtedly one of the best to suit my taste. But after dinner at Lailaty, I was craving something sweet and the Falooda in the menu was calling to me! Falooda it was. 

And my, was it a Lovely Surprise or what to find they do it with sweet yoghurt too!! Yum Yum! It looked mouthwatering when It came to our table and all that Jelly and Tapioca was blinging at me. The first spoonful was pure delight, although a word of warning, that yoghurt is Ah-Mazingly Thick and Creamy and Thick! It was a perfect blend of Sweet Yoghurt, Fleshy Grapes, Creamy Jelly and Tapioca! There was banana in it too, unfortunately for me. It was a Good Falooda although still not as good as Star and a little less sweet, especially at the bottom. 

Don't eat up all the Yoghurt at first go though, Mix it well in scoops that go all the way to the bottom and you won't be left slurping watery Tapioca in the Last Bite lol! But I'm still going to Star next time.

129   :   Place : @Chips n' Gravy

Item : Poutine (Roast Chicken)
Price : 250

Ingredients : Chicken gravy, Shredded Roast Chicken, Crispy  Chips, Paneer Cheese & Mushroom
Overall Taste : 2
Chip's Quality : 2
Cheese Quality : 1 
Chicken and Mushroom Quality : 6
Gravy Quality : 3
Presentation : 6
Service : 2
Atmosphere : 7
Value : 3

Poutine is known as an ultimate comfort food but the one that we were served was nothing like that. 
Firstly, no offense but 'Chips' tasted like potato fries made by our housemaid. They had brownish texture and tasted nothing like what we expected. We had the opportunity to look at the  chips before they went in the gravy and they looked pretty dull. We didn't expect crispy chips as from past experience we know chips in a Poutine  supposed to be mushy. I have no idea why their advertisement says 'Crispy Chips'.

Cheese!  We just can't  call that 'Paneer Cheese'. My mother-in-law makes paneer for me and I love them. What they used in the gravy was nothing but Dhaka Cheese, which is found in or outside every super shops and markets. We always eat Dhaka cheese cuz it's really cheap compared to the other ones(imported). We never expected them to serve such cheap quality cheese.

The chicken and gravy  was well cooked but we couldn't taste the chicken at all. Because, they used mushroom which had an odd taste and was really over-powering. Every single spoon from that dish had 1/2 mushroom in it. Don't get us wrong, we love mushroom. Back in the days, I used to cook a lot of mushroom for us. I use to make two different dishes only containing  mushrooms as main ingredient. I don't want to brag but, all of my friends used to love my mushroom dishes. So, I am assuming that their mushrooms were not fresh at all.

Presentation was a little average, nothing special. 

Service was really poor. After giving our order, we waited half an hour. Then, I lost patience and went over to the cart just to find out that they don't  have my order. They asked me, 'Who took your order?'. I was shocked and couldn't reply.  Suddenly a woman who seemed to be one of the owner, appeared from nowhere and asked me  'What did you order son? Is it Poutine ?'.  I said 'Yes mam, with mushroom' . She then asked me to go back inside and wait a few minutes more. I went back with a heavy heart. We waited another 15 minutes before the guy who took our order brought our food with a smile. He apologized saying, 'Sorry, I had to go to mosque for Namaz.'.

They have seating arrangement outside but it's being colonized by flies. Fortunately, they have sitting arrangement  inside too which was rather clean and peaceful.

Me and my other half both love food. We constantly search for different food. As a result, sometimes we do get disappointed but it never holds us down. As an ex McDonald's manager, I do understand that service can go bad when it's really busy, but food quality totally depends on the owners/management.  When we went there, they had only 1 customer. So, overall we were not pleased with their food and service at all.  

Unfortunately, we will have to go there again, but certainly for Madchef !

132   :   Smoked Fish & Chips in DHANMONDI! :D

Yupp! you read that right! finally a place in DHANMONDI that offers fish and chips and that too smoked! (they also have a regular version)

The fish tasted really great! the batter was well crispy and what complimented the fish was the home made tartar sauce..

The chips were made british style so its not the typical crispy fries but a more soggy-er version tossed in vinegar and salt. I am usually not a fan of 'non-crispy' chips so I never order wedges and stuff but this was indeed amazing! the vinegary kick makes is taste out of this world! 

Really very happy to have a fish & chips place in Dhanmondi! :)

['  (NE Delicious']




142   :   Places to visit in JFP
Every day there is Atleast one post regarding what to eat in jfp & because I am a frequent visitor I thought I would share my preferred places
1. Friday's - I really like their tangy chicken. It's big enough to be shared by 2 people but you may have to order an extra rice as it doesn't come with any. (8.5/10)
2. Subfactory - I am not a big fan of sandwiches but this place does have good ones. (8/10)
3. Poplar - I find all their desserts too sweet for my liking but others seem to really enjoy them. I only like their milk pudding. (7/10)
4. Ecstasy Caffe -I ordered a grilled chicken meal which  tasted good & was quite filling but it is a lil overpriced & the portions of other dishes are very small (7/10)
5. Urban spice - I went there with my family & had a very good meal. Their Tom yum soup had huge prawns & every single thing we ordered was very good (Thai fried rice, steamed lemon fish, some beef & chicken dish I can't remember the name of) but I've heard of other people having bad experiences which tells me their sservice isn't consistent (for me - 9/10)
6. Bnb - love their chicken teriyaki burger (9/10) 
7. Tekiya - I had the shrimp sushi & liked it but again ice hears mixed reviews of this place (for me - 8/10)
8. Khushbu - the yoghurt sorbet is very good but ask them not to add lemon to it (8/10)
9. Tabaq - liked their CB the first time but not so much the 2nd time but love their ferrero rocher shake.(8.5/10)
10. Happy bites - l liked their Oreo shake way better than tabaqs but I went there a long time ago & my sister went there recently & said that it sucked ( for me - a 9/10)
That's all for now ^_^

Review:
Rushing around town at mid-morning looking for a Birthday Cake for one of my Favorite Colleagues - Faria! Was gonna visit Decent but then suddenly saw the new Kings outlet next to LCBS Dhanmondi and opposite the soon-to-be-open GJC. 

Found this gorgeous Chocolate Ganache spread White and Milk Chocolate cake of Chocolate sponge. Topped with Cherries! And yum did it taste as good as it looked. The Ganache was Thick, Silky, Creamy and Rich! I even went back in the evening for the smaller one of 1/2 kg at 630/-. I think we licked the bottom clean and the cake served 10 of us perfectly right. 

And am I glad or what that they've opened up so close to work. One of the best bakeries around town indeed!

Review: As the new kids on the block, Suzuki coffee needs to step up its game. The hot coffee items were all solid performers, but not quiet up to the standards you would expect from an international chain. They offer nothing out of the ordinary and there definitely wasn't any 'wow' factor. But considering the introductory price of 70tk, it was good enough. 
The cold items killed it for me. They put way too much ice in the mug, and as a result, the coffee turned watery pretty fast. Maybe they're cutting back on ingredients for now due to the low price charged? I don't know...but hopefully they'll rectify this. Until then, don't go for the cold items. 
On a more positive note, the two foreign baristas/trainers are very friendly and helpful. To people in the restaurant industry...that's how its done!

233   :   Some recent foodie visits :3 
My favorite malta chaa and fuchka from 300 feet, Bashundhara R/A- 10 bucks for the tea, 30 for the fuchka. 
Platters, Nachos and tacos from Amigos along with a complimentary sizzling brownie.- Platters range starting from 300 onwards to 600 i think. Tacos and Nachos are around 300/-. I am not a big fan of Mexican food but i absolutely love their tacos, nachos and some of the chicken set menus. Great stuff! Highly recommended. The sizzling brownie is new and will be introduced to their menu soon, the owner was kind enough to offer it to us to try it :) 
Grilled squid and octopus (219/-) , thai clear soup (150 something i think) and basil squid (Something within 300), Sea food in mushroom (300 something, friend had it, said it was good) from Food Republic. I always have their grilled squid and octopus when i go there, it's my favorite. Can get extremely spicy sometimes, so those with who can't tolerate should tell them to turn down the heat. Thai clear soup and Basil squid is good stuff, would have preferred more gravy in the Squid though. Highly recommended!

258   :   Beans & Aroma
Hello,
I was really excited about Beans and Aroma opening in Uttara. I visited the place last week it was a horrendous experience. 
I was seated promptly but i had to wait for 15 minutes to get the menu. The music that was playing was so loud it was impossible for me to carry on a conversation. When I requested the volume to be turned down the waitress seemed annoyed and actually rolled her eyes :S .
When I wanted to order she refused to take down my order stating we have "pay first policy" and you have to go and order it yourself.
A minute ago she took an order for a gentleman sitting in the next table. When asked why wont she take our order, she mentioned that service was for our "regular customers" .
The manager was very helpful who apologized on her behalf and asked her to take down our order.

The place seems really nice and I thought it would be my new go to coffee place but I was really displeased by the standard of customer service.
 
Please train your waiter/waitresses to behave well with customers.

367   :   Just my opinion.
Recent days the food companies/ carts/ restaurants have been making continuously mistakes for food hygiene issue. No doubt for the last several months/ years foodies around Dhaka/ Bangladesh has raised a good number. so as their food business. 
That's the reason Cafe Appeliano - te manush er line diye seat booking rekhe 20 min wait kore khete hoto, ignoring their short space. I had been their regular customers from last year November. But I  stop from today.

This is their carelessness they have made and if they are not made realized what they are doing, they won't purify themselves- may be this is our nature in every sector.  We don't pay less to them, we go to good shops for quality food. not to get those Lizards/ Pins/ Hair piece in foods. But this is happening in good shops, pathetically true. Man deserves 2nd chances, but we people deserve punishment as we never purify ourselves without it.
I guess- WE Should find the carts/ shops/ restaurants through foodbanks and stop visiting as much as we can.  Other Good shops should also realize -in no means quality should not be degraded.  

Definitely- they will have good business if they serve well. But if they don't I think it shouldn't.

375   :   What is happening to the foods we eat outside?
We are paying them for a reason even then they don't give much attention to cleanliness and safety.
I am fine with people handling my food with unwashed hands,hair in my food,ants in my food but I expect this kind of unhygiene practice from food vendors on foothpaths like chotpoti wala etc,not from restaurants.
We pay extra for a reason.
A piece of steel found in a shwarma from Bar B Q Shwarma House in Baily Road.The consumer choked on it.Not a piece of hair or anything, she choked on A PIECE OF STEEL.Now she is admitted in a hospital.

And this other person found a baby lizard.
Not an ant or a mosquito,A LIZARD.

We need to make the owners of these restaurants realize their mistakes,and ensure that they dont do it again.This may seem petty but it is not.
If we don't nip the bud now,they will do worse.

I suggest to file a case against these restaurants to teach them a lesson and finally they make an attempt to take some responsibility.

The least we could do is spread the word about their unhygienic food and stop going there.Also encourage others to stop going there,so eventually their business runs out and they take these matters seriously then.

377   :   Went to Albino, Jamuna Future Park yesterday with a friend.  we ordered their chicken cashew nut salad. It was a horrible experience! the cashew nuts had a very bad smell and were chewy. so it was pretty obvious that they were old and stale. they put on some kind of chicken gravy, more like "murgir torkarir jhol" which made the salad way too spicy and it tasted absolutely disgusting. the chicken pieces were okay, not as crunchy as it should be. 
after eating a little, my tummy kind of started burning. we called the waiter and told him about the food. his reply was, " mam, chicken chicken cashew nut salad erokom e hoy, and walked to another table" :O
we had nothing more to say. we payed the bills and came back home. and now guess what? i am suffering from food poisoning. couldnt even go to work. and my friend vomited right after going home yesterday. WTH is wrong with all the restaurants?? >.<

so prices are without vat
red velvet- 60 tk taste 9/10 ( minus 1 for the size...they are small)
eclair- 80 tk 10/10 ( and now i wish they made it small...it was big)
bolognese poutine- 200 tk 8/10 (points deducted for giving frozen fries)
the only let down was they charged 30tk for a kaach er bottle er coke!
there are other carts as well like jerk burgers and something else and i am gonna go try them next week!

The ambience is awesome; is very attractive. It definitely does light up your mood and your expectation of the food instantly shoots up higher in the scale.

When you hear the name panir chilli fries, you immediately think of something with loads of cheese and fries, right?? WRONG! It is dry, and isn't fancy at all like their name suggests.

It will be good place to hang out if you are in a group and looking for something cheap and aren't a foodie.

Ratings:

Ambience: 9/10
Service: 8/10
Cheesesteak: 5/10
Panir chilli fries: 6/10
Money value: 7/10
Will I come back: probably to hang out with friends to snack on something, but not for heavy meal.

503   :   I discovered 'Hot Bread' accidentally when I went in to buy a cold drink over a year ago requiring wi-fi access as well.  I ended up returning for an evening meal & ordering their generously served Chicken Kiev dish @ 450 taka - a bargain!!  Since then it's my favourite stopping place wen in BD & based in Banani.  I've also introduced it to other family members who are also impressed

 The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavours spot on.  I loved the deshi influence with spinach (saag) style bhaji and touch of gravy within the mashed potato well!  

From the 2 pictures attached - the portion & presentation has stayed consistent.  One pic taken this week and the other pic was from last year

Now if you ask me which one is the best, then i will tell you each n every flavors. I asked the owner, what you call them? He replied, Milkshake. Yes its milkshake also you can say smoothie cause its too thick. Perfect flavor, perfect blending, perfect cold. In my view they can challenge any big restaurant of Dhaka in milkshake segment. I had two shakes before my lunch then after my lunch again went to test another two flavors, cause they are really so tasty n i live lil far from that place so every day i cant visit them. For everyone its a must try item. Price so reasonable only 45tk per glass.
