The rustic decor and the overall  ambience is just an added pleasure to the mouth watering food. Their small yet perfect menu consists of T bone, sirloin, cajun chicken and shrimp as entrees which comes with 2 sides and a salad. They also have wings and shrimp cocktails as appetizers which I have yet to try. \n\nSirloin steak - a big fat juicy piece cooked to perfection accompanied with creamy mashed potatoes and grilled veggies that have the right amount of crunchiness to it, just the way I like.\n\nCajun chicken - well seasoned and tender.\n\nCajun shrimp - great taste only that the shrimps were kinda small, the chef/owner Bappi Rahman informed us that he couldn't get the large ones for that day.\n\nThey are due to be fully launched by the end of this month, by then an extensive menu will be ready.
