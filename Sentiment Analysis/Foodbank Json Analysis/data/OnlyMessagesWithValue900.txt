I decided to try this place out while it is still in the soft opening phase. The steaks were high. \n\nApologies.\n\nAs soon as you enter the vicinity, the neon reds of the signs stand out, and candles light the way to the entrance making you feel like a contestant in the Amazing Race. Which is not a bad thing to be honest. The interiors are equally nice, and the attention to details must be applauded- it definitely feels like a rustic, yet warm place to dine in. Dimly lit, the tungsten lights set the mood real nice, complemented by a really good playlist that gently hums in the background (working class hero was the first song I heard).\n\nFor starters we ordered the Buffalo Wings, served with a hot sauce (there were mild and extra hot variants to choose from as well). It was served promptly, and that too, in generous amounts. The Pit Grill's take on a basic dish such as buffalo wings was nothing but sublime- the flavours infused deeply into the chicken, which were incredibly soft and moist. It is, hands down, the best version of buffalo wings I have ever tasted.\n\nIf an appetizer is supposed to make your appetite grow, the dish did exactly that. Even though I started the course being not as hungry, the buffalo wings made my taste buds tingle with joy as I hoped to unravel what else this new place had to offer.\n\nFast forward to the steaks. Please do remember that it is a soft opening, so there were basically three to choose from- Rib Eye, Sirloin, and Cajun Chicken. Each dish comes with a choice of two sides.\n\nMy sirloin piece- an intimidating 250g mass of beef, was cooked to perfection. I knew the 15 minute wait was worth it as soon as I saw the juices running across my plate as the steak made an impressive appearance. This is one of those rare times when I found my medium-rare steak medium-rare, and again, the flavours didn't disappoint, neither was it too chewy. Although I found a significant amount of fat along the borders of my steak, the overall perfection of the dish made me forget most of the sorrows of my life, let alone a bit of sinew.\n\nFor the sides, you can choose from a lot of potato-based dishes, which again, I don't mind. I am a potato person, you see. We tried all of them, and the baked potato was the weakest dish of the night, closely followed by the sauted veggies which lacked any punch. However, the french fries were golden bundles of joy descended from heaven itself- hand-cut and fried to perfection. Mashed potatoes didn't disappoint either. One thing about The Pit Grill- they are always generous with their servings.\n\nBut what really made this place great was the fact that the Head Chef would patrol the grounds himself and ask about your dining experience. He is one of those people you just know loves food when you look at him, and makes you want to hug him for cooking so magically. My dad, after receiving his Sirloin with veggies and baked potatoes, claimed he didn't order the baked potatoes (he did) ..but the chef was nice enough to serve us an extra plate of veggies. Throughout our dining experience, he was there..serving us food and being nice and all. Extra points to The Grill Pit on that one- really appreciated the gesture.\n\nThe chicken steak was good, but to me the Sirloin was the hero for the mains. You wouldn't even remember the sides because the steak is so good itself. 250g of sheer love, and sometimes, a wee bit too much as I couldn't finish mine. Maybe TPG could cut down on the quantity and make it a bit more affordable? I don't know.\n\nAt the end of a truly tantalising gastronomic experience, there was a hint of disappointment. We were charged with a 10% service charge. I do not complain for the existence of this service charge, because in all essence- the service was great. My disappointment lies in the fact that despite mentioning the 15% VAT in their quickly-drawn menu, they failed to mention the service charge anywhere. I hope this is rectified soon.\n\nBuffalo Wings- 400BDT 9.5/10\nSirloin Steak- 1050BDT 9/10\nCajun Chicken Steak- 950BDT 7.5/10\n----add: 15% VAT and 10% service charge (on base pay, not compounded)\n------no wi-fi...yet.\n\nBags of flavours, generous servings, thoughtful decor- The Pit Grill is sure to make some noise once it comes out with all its guns blazing. This might not be a place most people would be able to frequent, but I'd highly recommend the PTG experience just because of the sincerity and passion with which its head-honcho cooks up a storm.","Value":2},{"Message":null,"Value":0},{"Message":"Cox's bazar e valo crab ar lobster kon location e paua jay?","Value":0},{"Message":"It was the first time I had it today at Tabaq, Baridhara DOHS.

This restaurant caught my eye when I went to the The Cart Station located in Dhanmondi 3A today. I looked at the menu, went ahead and ordered the \"luchi thali\", priced at 99tk. \n\nI was really surprised when I saw the amount of food that came with this package. The luchis were really tasty. The daal and the alu'r dom tasted awesome ( I apologize as I don't know the exact names of the sides). The tangy spicy masala chicken was my personal favourite. In the day and age when you can hardly see the chicken in chicken dishes, this time it was pleasantly different. There was more than enough chicken along with more than enough of the sides to even fill the stomach of a big, chunky dude like your's truly :D. The delicious, sweet sponge roshogollah was the perfect ending to this meal. And ALL that for 99tk!! \n\nSo to sum it all up, the food was awesome, the owner's were super nice and the service was great too. I had never heard of this place before today, but will definitely go back. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. Give it a try and you wont be disappointed. \n\nFood: 9.5/10\nService: 10/10\nPrice: 11/10\n\nP.S: I wish I had taken pictures but couldn't, sorry guys!!","Value":2},{"Message":"Where I can I have some good brownies in Dhanmondi? \n\nThanks in advance. :)","Value":0},{"Message":"Grind house","Value":0},{"Message":null,"Value":0},{"Message":"‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶á ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶Æ ‡¶Æ‡¶ú‡¶æ","Value":1},{"Message":"#Delicious  <3\n\nTaste : 10 / 10\nService : 9 / 10\nEnvironment : 10 / 10","Value":1},{"Message":"Kalke kichu review dekhlam \"Ammu's Kitchen\" er so ajke decide korlam jawar , duitai menu One is \"Luchi thali\" and another is \"Manpasand biriyani\" duitai khub e mojar chilo , \"Luchi thali\" te chicken thake, daal tarka , alu achari chilo which was so yammmy ^_^ but chicken e oil ta aktu beshi chilo :( jaihok khabar anek moja chilo tai maf kore dilam :p oh ha akta roshogolla o chilo :D , Manpasand Biriyani o anek yammmy chilo :D , but ami aktu taste  korte perichilam .
