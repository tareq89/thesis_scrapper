The wait staff were very friendly and cordial. They had live sushi and tepenyaki stations. Other food items in buffet were all tasty. Desserts were to die for, I specially loved their pannacotta. Sometimes its better to pay a slightly higher price for great food and awesome service. Comparatively price was not that much higher than other leading Japanese/buffet restaurants in the city. Great place if you want to take someone out on a anniversary dinner or just chill with friends. If you are fan of Japanese food, then this is the place to be!! I would love to go back there again.

Today at Shawarma House(Baily Road) one person in disguise begged help from me and my friend. He was successful at convincing us that he was deaf and dumb and put a notebook on our table as if he was collecting help and recording in the book. we gave him some money. Suddenly we realized he didn't take only the money but the Samsung galaxy S4 phone of ma friends' as well. He came in such a way that we thought Shawarma House is making room for him to beg help.and we have never got tht deaf person and the phone is ultimately lost. when we started blaming Shawarma House that how come they don't care about customers' security and allow any ppl to enter and making our life miserable, they were charging us instead as if it was our fault. if they can't assure security of our belongings and allow anyone random to enter and steal belongings away i m not going there anymore. because i want to feel safe and secure.
