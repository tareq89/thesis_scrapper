Except for a few dishes most of the items didn't taste good. Soup was too sweet, wontons didn't have any flavour, battered fish fry was not seasoned, Bad spring rolls, pasta cooked like noodles without seasoning and very oily, they don't have the preparations to make you dosa immediately in the buffet and they take 25-30 mins to make the dosa and serve it to you, Beef was hard, vanilla mousse was set too much and didn't have that soft texture you expect in a mousse, strawberry tart had no trace of strawberry flavour, and the biggest disappointment red velvet cake- it wasn't anywhere near how a red velvet cake tastes like and didn't have cream cheese frosting but rather it was just a really sugary bad cake of red colour only and of normal vanilla frosting!! The worst was this so called red velvet cake which wasn't a red velvet cake at all.

We know most of the staff there by name and they know us. Tonight we had The Don pizza and a seafood Risotto. Total including a softdrink for my wife was AU$27.50. Two for one dinners on Monday night if you book and buy a drink each. I take a bottle of wine and we get the deal still because we are regulars. We even get our own special table.

Had a prone to go there after seeing reviews and went there with friends. I can’t tell anything but praise of their decoration ideas and ability to decipher. They embraced their visions and made the place aesthetic far beyond my expectations. Rooftop itself was stunning, stylish, yet warm blend of contemporary architecture. We found the staffs well behaved, gentle with words and posture. Dealt in the most patient and courteous way with us. Foods were mediocre. Could be little more flavoring. I must include the price (25% VAT).Overall bill was around 3000tk. A little bit intimidating comparing to foods. This was the only ephemeral disappointment for us. Overall a soothing place in this maladroit city.

Please advise.","Value":0},{"Message":"Accha apnara ki kew bolte paren valo pasta koi pawa jabe....ogreem dhonnobad","Value":0},{"Message":"These days it doesn't happen much that I am going to a single food place repeatedly, except for the campus canteen or that fuchka cart nearby. So the thought that I am going to this restaurant traveling ‘all the way’ from Segunbagicha to Banani for the third time in a short period of time managed to occupy my mind for a while. But I knew it was going to be worth it.\n\nI entered Entrée Café Lounge and went straight to my favorite corner to be disappointed by a ‘reserved’ sign on the table. Asked the waiter if the person for whom the table was reserved asked for this table specifically or not. Answering with a no, the waiter put the sign on another table and had me seated there. This ephemeral disappointment was the only one in the whole evening I must add.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my friend, the waiter came with the menu and asked me if I wanted to use the wifi (you don’t say?).  Despite having more data balance than I could consume in the whole month I took the password and started using the ‘free’ wifi when my friend showed up. The waiter started to talk about the promotional deal they were offering when I was like, ‘ভাই থামেন’ and asked to give us two BBQ platters, both medium rare.\n\nSoon the drinks came, the forks and knives came and and soon enough the food came. Was it not a view to watch. The T-bone steak, the grilled chicken breast and the lamb chop were tender, perfectly marinated and cooked. Tabasco and HP sauce were provided at request. The previous time I came here I had the steak well done while this time I did the মাতবরি to ask for medium rare which turned out to be not a wise decision FOR ME. I liked medium rare okay but I had liked well done better. Among them 3 (and the mashed potato insists to be mentioned at least once) I liked the tender and delicate grilled chicken breast the most. The cow, chicken and lamb made me more satisfied than I made my parents with my high school scores.\n\nThere are two factors I would like to emphasize on. Firstly, I found the waiters to be extremely well behaved. Polite and gentle with their words and posture they are nothing like those pizza hut waiters the fakeness of whose behavior can only be compared with Nicki Minaj’s butt. The guy who served us was probably the best waiter I have ever been attended by.\n\nSecondly, from what I have seen and what my friends have experienced I gathered that the place mostly remains empty. I have absolutely no clue why. All that food at that price, their taste, the nice ambiance, the extremely well behaved waiters, are not being able to attract enough customers. There could be only one explanation. We these days do not anymore ask for a good place to eat out at; we ask, “What are the NEW places to eat out at?” Our fooding experiences are not about having great food anymore, it’s about spending an outrageous amount of money on average food from ‘hyped’ places checking in from where gives us an opportunity to show off the amount of money we have asking to be wasted. This is sad, this is plain sad. To overcome this sadness, I am definitely going back to Entree Cafe Lounge.\n\nMy ratings:\nFood: 9/10\nAmbiance: 9/10\nService: 10/10","Value":2},{"Message":"Can anyone pls suggest some #restaurants  name  (mentioning items) at #JFP which will be worth tasting?
