Well umm just expressing my opinion through words. No, umm not the relative of the owner or any relative of its competitor. the review is a bit big so avoid it if u want. Price is somewhat reasonable. Amount is good for more than what they claim to be a platter for 2 or 4.\n\nOverall: yea, worth of giving a try and be a regular customer :D \n\nAnyways, i went to HAKKA DHAKA today for lunch. I was Satisfied. though the place wasn't that spacious. we ordered both the platters (A and B). 2 soft drinks were included in each of the platter. The people working there are really really good and humble. the place was comfy but a bit small.\nPlatter A:\n*Chicken wings was fried yet very juicy. the flavors were intact and the wings were perfectly cooked and glazed. 9/10\n*Hakka Noodles- well to be frank, it was not awesome but the flavors were satisfactory. Acceptable. 8/10\n*Egg fried rice- normal fried rice but a bit sweeter and has a subtle taste in it. Good. 8/10\n*Hunan Chicken- thumbs up from me. good chicken in a very smooth and light soy gravy i guess. it was awesome- 10/10\n*Mongolian Beef- for me, it wasn't that good. spicy enough, but i dint like the 'burnt flavor' as it was overpowering the other herbs. 6.5/10\n*Chili Garlic Prawns- Thumbs up. soft, perfectly cooked prawns, good size and good in amount too 10/10.\n\nPlatter B:\n*Wrapped Prawns: prawns wrapped in golden Chinese noodles and fried till perfection. the prawns were soft and perfectly cooked. 10/10\n*Hakka Noodles: its a common dish in both the platter. Mentioned its' review above.\n*Egg Fried Rice:  its also common dish in both the platter. Mentioned its' review above.\n*Chicken with Mushroom: Best dish ever. loved it like hell and more anything that time at least. 11/10\n*Dry Beef: it was kinda oily. Infused flavors. well it was average. 7/10.\n*Szechuan Prawns: thumbs up from my side. they are really good with their chicken and prawns. it was moist and full of flavors. a bit sweet though. 9.5/10.","Value":2},{"Message":"Bonjour foodbankers!!\nNeed suggestions on buffet restaurant services in or around dhanmondi!!\nTIA","Value":0},{"Message":"yummmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...pasta nd lemon crush...   \nfood--grind house special pasta nd lemon crush\ntaste--10/10\nservice--8/10","Value":2},{"Message":"Little piece of heaven Iffat Bahar Proma , Nazia Islam Trina  Rayyane Akib @camela\n@Tabaq","Value":0},{"Message":"any one knows of any food carts in shimanto square which serves fish and chips?","Value":1},{"Message":"Cooper's phone number?","Value":0},{"Message":"I liked it a lot... \nI'd rate their service 9/10\nFood quality 8.5/10\nAnd their voucher deal was a really good idea..

I, along with my friend, visited the place last week and was positively amazed! The place is like an oasis in the midst of chaotic, concrete city of Dhaka! I can hardly find any other restaurant in this city where you can enjoy your food laying your eyes on such a vast green field. \n\nThis restaurant is placed at the corner of Army Museum at Bijoy Shoroni, next to the Novo Theatre and it enjoys the openness of huge green playground of the Museum with the Army Museum itself as an added bonus. You can dine both inside the main restaurant building or outside under the tree in the open space; After all, who want to miss such opportunity to sit in greenery in this green-less Dhaka city?!?\n \nWe picked Barbecue items and the foods were really delicious and plentiful! I personally liked their Nun a lot. They know how to make Barbecue keeping the juiciness intact! \n\nNow, about the Service. To our delight, the waiter who served us ‘Joy’ was extremely polite and always with a big smile, which is not very common in our service industry. We will certainly ask for him in our next visit.
