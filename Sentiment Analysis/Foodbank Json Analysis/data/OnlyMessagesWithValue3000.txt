It's called Monster Spiced. The thing that I absolutely love about this burger is that it delivers all the needed and right amount of flavors. Although it has the name 'spiced' to it, it's not the type of burger you eat half way and cry for water. Best thing about it is that you do get the spicy tinge on your tongue and at the same time the flavors of the deliciously juicy grilled patty. It's just the right amount of spice to enjoy well blended flavors. Its a burger to enjoy and not regret. \n\nSorry to say this but in comparison to Naga Inc, it just blows them out of the water. You get to taste a lot more than just raw deadly spice and dry tasteless patties. \n\nIf you like spicy with a twist then this is the burger for you. \n\n(I recommend chicken) \n\nBravo Monster Foods! \n\nVerdict: 10/10","Value":2},{"Message":"Thx my dear wife.","Value":0},{"Message":"Heaven it is ! \nI am really grateful to \"Star Restaurant\" that their restaurant is close to my home.
