I have had this before and it is still one of the best tasting and cheapest fish and chips around! Nothing way over the top but it's still pretty good. It was a tad bit oily today, but nevertheless, it tasted good, well seasoned, perfectly fried and i feel the quantity is super value for price! Highly recommended. \n- Fried Calamari from WTF (What the Fish). (220/-, Location: Near the Luam's and Puran Dacca Alley, Banani). I swear to god, i literally said \"WTF is this crap?\" the moment i tasted this. Possibly has to be the WORST calamari i have ever had. It was fried in the weirdest tasting batter and it smelled of stale soyabean oil and was extremely salty. No flavor whatsoever, soaking with oil and the batter was weirdly soft, crumbly and tasted like idk fried cotton or smth. A 5 year old can make better batter with dim and moida than this. NOT RECOMMENDED. \n- Tiramisu Doughnut from King's (70/-).
