The set menu was satisfactory but the pasta was a bit disappointment, anyways I must say they have improved their quality in the PASTAS, still it was a bit sweetish which I hate the most when it comes to pasta, though I suggested them to cook it salty. It was salty and chilli but not salty enough, still the sweetness was there, but still GOOD. On a fine note, the amount of the pasta was really satisfactory.\nAs far as the BURGER is concerned nothing wrong in it, infact it was pretty adequate.\nThe prices are reasonable too, if you want to have a good time with your friends / family, GRIND HOUSE is the place for you :)\n\nRating - \nChicken Pasta : 7/10 (240tk)\nBeef Cheese Burger (with french fries) : 7.5/10 (160tk)\nEnvironment / Ambience - 9/10",

As easy as setting up a school was, I actually thought of registering it as a non-profitable foundation with the aim that I would use the the profit for charity. Upon paying all the expenses, the money would go for the underprivileged needy women of our society.\nI seek all your Doa so that the foundation can one day bring significant positive changes.\nPlease kindly contact me to get enrolled in the institution.

  "A place that finally lives up to the dozen of good reviews about it. Angels n' Gypsies. Location: Banani. (Near Airtel office, where panini was previously.)\n- Chicken Teriyaki (540/-)- Excellent dish, and quantity! One of the best teriyaki dishes i have had in a while where the consistency of flavors are just right. In other places they usually end up overcooking the sauce which brings out a bitter taste. The chicken was juicy, succulent and the mash potato was perfect. Very filling. We scraped our plates clean! :D\n- Calamari (340/-): It was good, nothing extra awesome, i feel the melted cheese overpowered the taste a little but hey, who am i to complain about more cheese? :P \n- Chicken Quesdilla (280/-ish i guess): Superb starter, filled with the right proportion of meat and cheese, comes with sour cream and a salad. \n\nAlso, there was a santa who gave us chocolates and we took a selfie with him! ^_^ :P \n\nHighly recommended, defo going back for more. <3\nVery reasonably priced, value for money considering the nice interiors. staff and ambiance as well. Starters go maximum upto 500/- and mains are priced upto a max of 800/- ish.",

I have had this before and it is still one of the best tasting and cheapest fish and chips around! Nothing way over the top but it's still pretty good. It was a tad bit oily today, but nevertheless, it tasted good, well seasoned, perfectly fried and i feel the quantity is super value for price! Highly recommended. \n- Fried Calamari from WTF (What the Fish). (220/-, Location: Near the Luam's and Puran Dacca Alley, Banani). I swear to god, i literally said \"WTF is this crap?\" the moment i tasted this. Possibly has to be the WORST calamari i have ever had. It was fried in the weirdest tasting batter and it smelled of stale soyabean oil and was extremely salty. No flavor whatsoever, soaking with oil and the batter was weirdly soft, crumbly and tasted like idk fried cotton or smth. A 5 year old can make better batter with dim and moida than this. NOT RECOMMENDED. \n- Tiramisu Doughnut from King's (70/-).

They had live sushi and tepenyaki stations. Other food items in buffet were all tasty. Desserts were to die for, I specially loved their pannacotta. Sometimes its better to pay a slightly higher price for great food and awesome service. Comparatively price was not that much higher than other leading Japanese/buffet restaurants in the city. Great place if you want to take someone out on a anniversary dinner or just chill with friends. If you are fan of Japanese food, then this is the place to be!! I would love to go back there again.

  "I am speechless to see how these restaurants are allowing any people regardless of being thief  to enter in disguise and stealing our belongings. Today at Shawarma House(Baily Road) one person in disguise begged help from me and my friend. He was successful at convincing us that he was deaf and dumb and put a notebook on our table as if he was collecting help and recording in the book. we gave him some money. Suddenly we realized he didn't take only the money but the Samsung galaxy S4 phone of ma friends' as well. He came in such a way that we thought Shawarma House is making room for him to beg help.and we have never got tht deaf person and the phone is ultimately lost. when we started blaming Shawarma House that how come they don't care about customers' security and allow any ppl to enter and making our life miserable, they were charging us instead as if it was our fault. if they can't assure security of our belongings and allow anyone random to enter and steal belongings away i m not going there anymore. because i want to feel safe and secure.

The buns were very soft as well, and overall the burger was excellent. Cost 375tk. without VAT.

So here we go....\n\n I have been going to the same Italian restaurant (Roman Empire, in Mount Gravatt, Brisbane Australia) with my wife on Monday nights for over a year now. We know most of the staff there by name and they know us. Tonight we had The Don pizza and a seafood Risotto. Total including a softdrink for my wife was AU$27.50. Two for one dinners on Monday night if you book and buy a drink each. I take a bottle of wine and we get the deal still because we are regulars. We even get our own special table. Service as always would have to be a 10/10. Food tonight was a 9/10 (I dont really like seafood risotto but my wife does).",

  "Slush of my last week jaunt at Bird's Eye Roof Top Restaurant. Had a prone to go there after seeing reviews and went there with friends. I can‚Äôt tell anything but praise of their decoration ideas and ability to decipher. They embraced their visions and made the place aesthetic far beyond my expectations. Rooftop itself was stunning, stylish, yet warm blend of contemporary architecture. We found the staffs well behaved, gentle with words and posture. Dealt in the most patient and courteous way with us. Foods were mediocre. Could be little more flavoring. I must include the price (25% VAT).Overall bill was around 3000tk. A little bit intimidating comparing to foods. This was the only ephemeral disappointment for us. Overall a soothing place in this maladroit city.

  "These days it doesn't happen much that I am going to a single food place repeatedly, except for the campus canteen or that fuchka cart nearby. So the thought that I am going to this restaurant traveling ‚Äòall the way‚Äô from Segunbagicha to Banani for the third time in a short period of time managed to occupy my mind for a while. But I knew it was going to be worth it.\n\nI entered Entr√©e Caf√© Lounge and went straight to my favorite corner to be disappointed by a ‚Äòreserved‚Äô sign on the table. Asked the waiter if the person for whom the table was reserved asked for this table specifically or not. Answering with a no, the waiter put the sign on another table and had me seated there. This ephemeral disappointment was the only one in the whole evening I must add.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my friend, the waiter came with the menu and asked me if I wanted to use the wifi (you don‚Äôt say?).  Despite having more data balance than I could consume in the whole month I took the password and started using the ‚Äòfree‚Äô wifi when my friend showed up. The waiter started to talk about the promotional deal they were offering when I was like, ‚Äò‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßá‡¶®‚Äô and asked to give us two BBQ platters, both medium rare.\n\nSoon the drinks came, the forks and knives came and and soon enough the food came. Was it not a view to watch. The T-bone steak, the grilled chicken breast and the lamb chop were tender, perfectly marinated and cooked. Tabasco and HP sauce were provided at request. The previous time I came here I had the steak well done while this time I did the ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶¨‡¶∞‡¶ø to ask for medium rare which turned out to be not a wise decision FOR ME. I liked medium rare okay but I had liked well done better. Among them 3 (and the mashed potato insists to be mentioned at least once) I liked the tender and delicate grilled chicken breast the most. The cow, chicken and lamb made me more satisfied than I made my parents with my high school scores.\n\nThere are two factors I would like to emphasize on. Firstly, I found the waiters to be extremely well behaved. Polite and gentle with their words and posture they are nothing like those pizza hut waiters the fakeness of whose behavior can only be compared with Nicki Minaj‚Äôs butt. The guy who served us was probably the best waiter I have ever been attended by.\n\nSecondly, from what I have seen and what my friends have experienced I gathered that the place mostly remains empty. I have absolutely no clue why. All that food at that price, their taste, the nice ambiance, the extremely well behaved waiters, are not being able to attract enough customers. There could be only one explanation. We these days do not anymore ask for a good place to eat out at; we ask, ‚ÄúWhat are the NEW places to eat out at?‚Äù Our fooding experiences are not about having great food anymore, it‚Äôs about spending an outrageous amount of money on average food from ‚Äòhyped‚Äô places checking in from where gives us an opportunity to show off the amount of money we have asking to be wasted. This is sad, this is plain sad. To overcome this sadness, I am definitely going back to Entree Cafe Lounge.\n\nMy ratings:\nFood: 9/10\nAmbiance: 9/10\nService: 10/10",

  "Foodwatch: The Grill Pit\n\nLiving in borderline Lalmatia, I was delighted to hear that Dhanmondi will finally boast its very own steak experts in the form of The Pit Grill. I decided to try this place out while it is still in the soft opening phase. The steaks were high. \n\nApologies.\n\nAs soon as you enter the vicinity, the neon reds of the signs stand out, and candles light the way to the entrance making you feel like a contestant in the Amazing Race. Which is not a bad thing to be honest. The interiors are equally nice, and the attention to details must be applauded- it definitely feels like a rustic, yet warm place to dine in. Dimly lit, the tungsten lights set the mood real nice, complemented by a really good playlist that gently hums in the background (working class hero was the first song I heard).\n\nFor starters we ordered the Buffalo Wings, served with a hot sauce (there were mild and extra hot variants to choose from as well). It was served promptly, and that too, in generous amounts. The Pit Grill's take on a basic dish such as buffalo wings was nothing but sublime- the flavours infused deeply into the chicken, which were incredibly soft and moist. It is, hands down, the best version of buffalo wings I have ever tasted.\n\nIf an appetizer is supposed to make your appetite grow, the dish did exactly that. Even though I started the course being not as hungry, the buffalo wings made my taste buds tingle with joy as I hoped to unravel what else this new place had to offer.\n\nFast forward to the steaks. Please do remember that it is a soft opening, so there were basically three to choose from- Rib Eye, Sirloin, and Cajun Chicken. Each dish comes with a choice of two sides.\n\nMy sirloin piece- an intimidating 250g mass of beef, was cooked to perfection. I knew the 15 minute wait was worth it as soon as I saw the juices running across my plate as the steak made an impressive appearance. This is one of those rare times when I found my medium-rare steak medium-rare, and again, the flavours didn't disappoint, neither was it too chewy. Although I found a significant amount of fat along the borders of my steak, the overall perfection of the dish made me forget most of the sorrows of my life, let alone a bit of sinew.\n\nFor the sides, you can choose from a lot of potato-based dishes, which again, I don't mind. I am a potato person, you see. We tried all of them, and the baked potato was the weakest dish of the night, closely followed by the sauted veggies which lacked any punch. However, the french fries were golden bundles of joy descended from heaven itself- hand-cut and fried to perfection. Mashed potatoes didn't disappoint either. One thing about The Pit Grill- they are always generous with their servings.\n\nBut what really made this place great was the fact that the Head Chef would patrol the grounds himself and ask about your dining experience. He is one of those people you just know loves food when you look at him, and makes you want to hug him for cooking so magically. My dad, after receiving his Sirloin with veggies and baked potatoes, claimed he didn't order the baked potatoes (he did) ..but the chef was nice enough to serve us an extra plate of veggies. Throughout our dining experience, he was there..serving us food and being nice and all. Extra points to The Grill Pit on that one- really appreciated the gesture.\n\nThe chicken steak was good, but to me the Sirloin was the hero for the mains. You wouldn't even remember the sides because the steak is so good itself. 250g of sheer love, and sometimes, a wee bit too much as I couldn't finish mine. Maybe TPG could cut down on the quantity and make it a bit more affordable? I don't know.\n\nAt the end of a truly tantalising gastronomic experience, there was a hint of disappointment. We were charged with a 10% service charge. I do not complain for the existence of this service charge, because in all essence- the service was great. My disappointment lies in the fact that despite mentioning the 15% VAT in their quickly-drawn menu, they failed to mention the service charge anywhere. I hope this is rectified soon.\n\nBuffalo Wings- 400BDT 9.5/10\nSirloin Steak- 1050BDT 9/10\nCajun Chicken Steak- 950BDT 7.5/10\n----add: 15% VAT and 10% service charge (on base pay, not compounded)\n------no wi-fi...yet.\n\nBags of flavours, generous servings, thoughtful decor- The Pit Grill is sure to make some noise once it comes out with all its guns blazing. This might not be a place most people would be able to frequent, but I'd highly recommend the PTG experience just because of the sincerity and passion with which its head-honcho cooks up a storm.",

  "Hey how can you not try out a place named Ammu's Kitchen, right? This restaurant caught my eye when I went to the The Cart Station located in Dhanmondi 3A today. I looked at the menu, went ahead and ordered the \"luchi thali\", priced at 99tk. \n\nI was really surprised when I saw the amount of food that came with this package. The luchis were really tasty. The daal and the alu'r dom tasted awesome ( I apologize as I don't know the exact names of the sides). The tangy spicy masala chicken was my personal favourite. In the day and age when you can hardly see the chicken in chicken dishes, this time it was pleasantly different. There was more than enough chicken along with more than enough of the sides to even fill the stomach of a big, chunky dude like your's truly :D. The delicious, sweet sponge roshogollah was the perfect ending to this meal. And ALL that for 99tk!! \n\nSo to sum it all up, the food was awesome, the owner's were super nice and the service was great too. I had never heard of this place before today, but will definitely go back. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. Give it a try and you wont be disappointed. \n\nFood: 9.5/10\nService: 10/10\nPrice: 11/10\n\nP.S: I wish I had taken pictures but couldn't, sorry guys!!",

The chicken wings were the perfect blend of spices and was cooked to perfection. The best part of the dinner was the sirloin steak. It was the perfect medium rare, and the accompanying mashed potato and fries were a great combination. Cajun grilled shrimp was a part of the meal, although served a bit late the owner was kind enough to not charge extra for it and the shrimps were fantastic. Overall the service was great, the food was excellent, the price was very reasonable and the decor had the rustic ambience of a steak house somewhere in Texas, and for a moment I forgot I was in Dhanmondi.

[Price: 70-80 each]\nBeef Shik Kabab: 8/10. not like regular shik kababs. it was not full dry and that's why it tastes good.

Bt now it's Tk. 50. So try it before Chacha increases it again.\nand ya.... better if you go there before the evening otherwise you're gonna taste the food and the mosquitoes will be tasting your blood.

They also have wings and shrimp cocktails as appetizers which I have yet to try. \n\nSirloin steak - a big fat juicy piece cooked to perfection accompanied with creamy mashed potatoes and grilled veggies that have the right amount of crunchiness to it, just the way I like.\n\nCajun chicken - well seasoned and tender.\n\nCajun shrimp - great taste only that the shrimps were kinda small, the chef/owner Bappi Rahman informed us that he couldn't get the large ones for that day.\n\nThey are due to be fully launched by the end of this month, by then an extensive menu will be ready.

  "Ordered the Smoked Chicken sandwich and french fries from SubCity today. it was DISGUSTING. I mean the fries aren't even fries.my mom cooks better fries at home. And the sandwich oh gawd too much sauce and mustard and too slimyy .\nIf you love your food life then please don't go here it sucks big time.",

Hats off to their hospitality :D",

  "My first time at Barista Lavazza. Went mainly because of the reviews about the Chocolate doughnut! \nBlueberry Cheesecake (250tk) - not bad, but Bittersweet is still the best. \nChocolate Doughnut (100tk) - the main attraction; but I did not like it that much. Too much chocolaty; someone who really lives chocolate would dig it. \nHazelnut Mocha (260tk) - you can never go wrong with a hazelnut mocha. A little bitter, pretty strong caffeine, but just the way I like it. \nChicken smoked sandwich (320tk) \nMr. Fudge the Brownie (125tk) \n(Didn't taste the last two because they were takeaways for Ammu)\nVAT (158tk)\nAmbiance 5/10.\nService 7/10 (they forgot to serve the coffee, but was very nice about it)",

  "Review time. Well umm just expressing my opinion through words. No, umm not the relative of the owner or any relative of its competitor. the review is a bit big so avoid it if u want. Price is somewhat reasonable. Amount is good for more than what they claim to be a platter for 2 or 4.\n\nOverall: yea, worth of giving a try and be a regular customer :D \n\nAnyways, i went to HAKKA DHAKA today for lunch. I was Satisfied. though the place wasn't that spacious. we ordered both the platters (A and B). 2 soft drinks were included in each of the platter. The people working there are really really good and humble. the place was comfy but a bit small.\nPlatter A:\n*Chicken wings was fried yet very juicy. the flavors were intact and the wings were perfectly cooked and glazed. 9/10\n*Hakka Noodles- well to be frank, it was not awesome but the flavors were satisfactory. Acceptable. 8/10\n*Egg fried rice- normal fried rice but a bit sweeter and has a subtle taste in it. Good. 8/10\n*Hunan Chicken- thumbs up from me. good chicken in a very smooth and light soy gravy i guess. it was awesome- 10/10\n*Mongolian Beef- for me, it wasn't that good. spicy enough, but i dint like the 'burnt flavor' as it was overpowering the other herbs. 6.5/10\n*Chili Garlic Prawns- Thumbs up. soft, perfectly cooked prawns, good size and good in amount too 10/10.\n\nPlatter B:\n*Wrapped Prawns: prawns wrapped in golden Chinese noodles and fried till perfection. the prawns were soft and perfectly cooked. 10/10\n*Hakka Noodles: its a common dish in both the platter. Mentioned its' review above.\n*Egg Fried Rice:  its also common dish in both the platter. Mentioned its' review above.\n*Chicken with Mushroom: Best dish ever. loved it like hell and more anything that time at least. 11/10\n*Dry Beef: it was kinda oily. Infused flavors. well it was average. 7/10.\n*Szechuan Prawns: thumbs up from my side. they are really good with their chicken and prawns. it was moist and full of flavors. a bit sweet though. 9.5/10.",

The presentation was nice....I spoiled it before taking the picture...my bad :p .... Anyways I'll rate it 9/10\n\nYes ...My misconception was cleared today...it's not Brac Inn's official\nresturant...anyone is\nallowed....\n\nSo if you're ever nearby Brac Center Inn...do give it a try :)",

  "The Entrance @ Museum Restaurant‚Äô, while it is been there for more than a couple of years, I guess! I, along with my friend, visited the place last week and was positively amazed! The place is like an oasis in the midst of chaotic, concrete city of Dhaka! I can hardly find any other restaurant in this city where you can enjoy your food laying your eyes on such a vast green field. \n\nThis restaurant is placed at the corner of Army Museum at Bijoy Shoroni, next to the Novo Theatre and it enjoys the openness of huge green playground of the Museum with the Army Museum itself as an added bonus. You can dine both inside the main restaurant building or outside under the tree in the open space; After all, who want to miss such opportunity to sit in greenery in this green-less Dhaka city?!?\n \nWe picked Barbecue items and the foods were really delicious and plentiful! I personally liked their Nun a lot. They know how to make Barbecue keeping the juiciness intact! \n\nNow, about the Service. To our delight, the waiter who served us ‚ÄòJoy‚Äô was extremely polite and always with a big smile, which is not very common in our service industry. We will certainly ask for him in our next visit. Pictures I have given below aren't expressing full amount of foods. We ate little bit before clicking.\n\nItems : (believe me, their Nun & Salad are too good & tasty)\n\n1. Smoked Chicken with Butter Nun & Salads (quarter : 320/-)\n2. B.B.Q. Chicken with Butter Nun & Salads (quarter : 320/-)\n3.

Purchase Tk 300 and get 1 pc chicken , 1 fries and 1 regular drinks.\n\nUsually you need to do the survey within 3 days of initial purchase and redeem the offer within 21 days.

  "Few days ago i visited this local kabab restaurant\"Bismillah kabab Ghor\". Its in \"Nazira Bazar, Alauddin Road\". Its a narrow little restaurant. like a narrow passage. There were three tables in a row of four sitting. It is two storied. The tawa kabab of chicken and beef is awesome. They also give a papaya salad with cucumber and black vinegar. The \"parata's\" are real thin and nice when served hot. They also give turmeric chutney which is good. Its very cheap. I had a beef kabab and five parata's about 60tk. I think it was worth it. So if u want to taste u may try it. Best wishes.",

Decided to order Food Republic food through Foodpanda, & boy am I disappointed with the food -_-\nI ordered:\n1. Grilled squid & octopus- spicy, interesting flavours, a little too hard instead of chewy. 7/10\n2. Pad Thai with prawn- tasted almost bland to be honest (found just 2 prawns) with a hint of sugar & nuts. 5/10\n3. Chicken cashew nut salad- tasted decent. For the price, the amount of chicken and salad was alright, but could not find many cashews. 7/10\n4. Thai clear soup- tasted good at the first sip, then left a strongly weird after taste. 5/10\n5. Chicken in mushroom sauce- Dismal! Utterly dismal tasting curry dish that had a few bits of mushrooms & smelled oddly like raw fish. Just awful! 1/10.\nI feel worse than I did before having the food, there goes 1,535tk I will never see again :(",

I hope people would spread Kurkure around in more shops after this post. :3  But my main query to all you foodbankers is this that...\n\nOnce like a few years ago there was this rumour that if you melt Kurkure in direct heat, it will melt slowly and one would see that plastic is melting. :O Which is why for some years we didn't have Kurkure chips at all. That was the Indian one though. \n\nSo...is that true anymore? Like does Kurkure still have plastic in it? I hope not. Cuz its made in our country now and it tastes awesome!

The menu is very simple which is similar to Chittagong Express but with Mejbani Gost, Chona Dal, Paya and Akhni but they have several packages. The price is quite reasonable and the quantity is satisfactory. Ideal for family hangouts. Though i believe they need to work a little more on their their Akhni and Paya.

  "First of all thank goodness Monster Foods decided to open everyday at 12 in the afternoon and not 4 in the evening anymore. \n\nHowever, this is Monster Foods newest addition to their burgers. It's called Monster Spiced. The thing that I absolutely love about this burger is that it delivers all the needed and right amount of flavors. Although it has the name 'spiced' to it, it's not the type of burger you eat half way and cry for water. Best thing about it is that you do get the spicy tinge on your tongue and at the same time the flavors of the deliciously juicy grilled patty. It's just the right amount of spice to enjoy well blended flavors. Its a burger to enjoy and not regret. \n\nSorry to say this but in comparison to Naga Inc, it just blows them out of the water. You get to taste a lot more than just raw deadly spice and dry tasteless patties. \n\nIf you like spicy with a twist then this is the burger for you. \n\n(I recommend chicken) \n\nBravo Monster Foods! \n\nVerdict: 10/10",

The place could do a bit of rennovation but I guess they know their food is too good and will have customers anyway.\n\nThis burger was giant and I loved it! The patty was yummy, there was right amount of mayo and each layer had cheese. They gave french fries too! And all these for only 200tk and no vat!\n\nI highly recommend this place! You wont regret it!",

Let me know how was it to you. :) \nAnyways, let's just say it has both positives and negatives! Simply put - Four beef patties, \"tub\" of cheese :3 and to top it all off there was one or two strips of bacons ( Yes, it's also beef so save the arguments :p ). The cheese is the negative side of BnB burgers. Why? I get it, a burger is incomplete without cheese BUT THEY JUST OVERLOAD WIV IT SO MUCH that I, or anyone, could never taste the patties to the fullest. :| Anyways, fortunately the topmost patty had less cheese and I could actually taste the patty fully and it was good, tbh. :D Fresh and perfect. The whole burger was tummy filling and I was happy hehe. ^_^ It's a good burger but they could also put some veggies on it to taste better. To me, it was worth the bucks and worth the waiting but improving it a bit won't do any harm. :D\n\nName : Beef Hoard \nPrice : 375tk \nLocation : Dhanmondi 5/A (Few feet from ULAB)",

  "Places to visit in JFP\nEvery day there is Atleast one post regarding what to eat in jfp & because I am a frequent visitor I thought I would share my preferred places\n1. Friday's - I really like their tangy chicken. It's big enough to be shared by 2 people but you may have to order an extra rice as it doesn't come with any. (8.5/10)\n2. Subfactory - I am not a big fan of sandwiches but this place does have good ones. (8/10)\n3. Poplar - I find all their desserts too sweet for my liking but others seem to really enjoy them. I only like their milk pudding. (7/10)\n4. Ecstasy Caffe -I ordered a grilled chicken meal which  tasted good & was quite filling but it is a lil overpriced & the portions of other dishes are very small (7/10)\n5. Urban spice - I went there with my family & had a very good meal. Their Tom yum soup had huge prawns & every single thing we ordered was very good (Thai fried rice, steamed lemon fish, some beef & chicken dish I can't remember the name of) but I've heard of other people having bad experiences which tells me their sservice isn't consistent (for me - 9/10)\n6. Bnb - love their chicken teriyaki burger (9/10) \n7. Tekiya - I had the shrimp sushi & liked it but again ice hears mixed reviews of this place (for me - 8/10)\n8. Khushbu - the yoghurt sorbet is very good but ask them not to add lemon to it (8/10)\n9. Tabaq - liked their CB the first time but not so much the 2nd time but love their ferrero rocher shake.(8.5/10)\n10. Happy bites - l liked their Oreo shake way better than tabaqs but I went there a long time ago & my sister went there recently & said that it sucked ( for me - a 9/10)\nThat's all for now ^_^",

I didnt really like the whole bread idea and it wasnt as good as it would have been with a bun. all the menus are the same but without a bun, its just not it sadly :/ this is their well known naga-blast. now its still good but nowhere near as good as it was before. i hope they come up with something soon. this is just sad :(",

And never thought to give it a try thinking it's just another sweet place? I've done that for a year until my bloke dragged me there one evening out of my regular route to Almas. And the year since then, I've rarely missed a pit stop here!\n\nYes, it's a Sweet shop. And yes, it does all the regular sweets. Tried them all. They're all good. But I only stop here for their Signature item. Chocolate Laddoo. Yep. Chocolate. In the form of a Laddoo. It's ridiculously gorgeous. \n\nChocolate flavored fleshy chunk interspread with finely chopped pieces of almond. Mouthwatering mouthful. You can definitely eat in a single mouthful, if you have a large-ish jaw but you'll only ever want to savor it. In little spoonfuls. Let the flavor and taste melt on your tongue and crackle your tastebuds little at a time. And even then you'll go back for another one (I always do)!! Or maybe even a hefty kilo of the sweet for midnight specials. \n\nTo think all the wasted opportunities before I was made to stop for a bite. No wasted opportunity today!

  "Hello foodbankers! this would be my first review here. so pardon me for any unintentional mistakes :)\nitem: All American BBQ Burger \nplace: Grilled. they used to be a food cart but now they moved in permanently as a street burger shack at dhanmodi 27 no. road.\ninfo: just wanted to explore a new place so went there. ordered an all american bbq burger yesterday worth 160 taka. looked nothing fancy but when i grabbed my first bite, BOY i was surprised, i mean pleasantly. the burger was a flavor bomb that burst my taste buds. the beef patty, mayo, bbq sauce, mustard sauce, jalapeno, egg all the ingredients were playing their role perfectly to create a unique combination of taste in a single mouthful of bite. the patty was hefty for the price tag. the burger was neither dry nor too juicy and had just the right proportions of everything. didnt even have to use any extra sauce as i liked the way it was. and was a very satisfying experience indeed.\nbtw, the burger in the pic shown here contains double patty. the taste dragged me there again today and as i was hungry so ordered a double patty one. same great taste which had extra meat but i'd recommend standard one as i liked that better than what i had today.\nRating: \ntaste- 9/10\nvalue: 9.5/10",

And last but not the least what I loved the most was their chutney type cucumber salad,it was a total balanced thing I mean not so sour like the other chutnies not so spicey or sweet,it was just perfect,i wonder is it always this yummy?(aww! Damn it was so good,too good actually. Tasted awesome)\nWell I would say,Todays food was infact much better than mohammadpurs famous mostakim(when I had their food last time I remember their luchis were hard,tikka was good though but the boti kababs were not that awesome,besides they also don't have such awesome salads.)

Especially if you're looking for a healthier option then Shingara, Samosa or Tehari, Biriyani variety. Starving along with 7 others at 3pm, one of the boss men finally suggest Candyfloss's Club Sandwich!\n\nNow, although Candyfloss is right in my office backyard, somehow I've never made it there for their lunch menu, only drinks. I was actually pretty hesitant as I'd learnt in the last year that nowhere in Dhaka there is any decent Soup, Salad or Sandwich (my staple lunch diet) joint for lunch on a budget. But oh well, hunger calls!\n\nAnd when the Sandwiches came, we literally attacked the plate. But oh no, we were not ready for the best part. The sandwiches were so damn scrumptious with the double decker slabs crammed full of well shredded and seasoned boneless chicken, cheese, egg, salad and a light hand with the mayo... Tastebuds exploded after the first bite!! We raved and eyes popped at the combination of Quality, Quantity and Price - today's undoubted winner at the meeting.... Oh and we already have plans to order our next work date lunch from here again! \n\nFinally, Finally, Finally, my search for good, no, Great Sandwich is over - I've got Candyfloss *happy sigh*!",

  "Place: Kutumbari 0 km\nOrder: \nMughal Package Meal 5: 200/-\nSeafood Pasta: 175/-\nNB: No VAT or SC\n\nReview:\nStarved after a dragging work day. Decided to hit Kutumbari, being the closest to sate my tummy. Only had a set meal here once before and liked it. It definitely had potential for a second time. And boy oh boy, was I glad to be here for lunch or what!\n\nThe Mughal Package was of Luchi (6pcs), as big as parathas as you can see, and Beef Kala Bhuna. And guess what, it was absolutely perfect. The blend of spices in the meat, the gorgeous Luchi and that extra green chilli sauce I asked for. I licked my fingers clean. Would have done the same to my plate too. Perfect to fill you up at 200/- and trust me, I can eat the same as two people at a table!!\n\nI was actually dreading the pasta a bit. It's a tricky dish, what with quantity, quality and price issues we all face when we see the 175/- tag for any kind of good pasta. But it turned out to be the real surprise! The Tagliatelle itself was a surprise, most places don't do it, that too as decent as this. O.M.G. the amount of baby octopi, Calamari rings, Bhetki (what's it in English if anyone knows?) chunks and the Prawns completely bowled me over. Yes, they can definitely do with a bit less tomato sauce and Mixed spice, but hell my tastebuds went gaga for that smoky zing at first bite. Abso-Bloody-Lutely Loved it. And at that price, Eeeek, Ima go crash again soon! Oh, and look, baby octopus!\n\nNext is their Fish menu... Salmon, Snapper and Lobster in 150-200gm portions at prices that range 175-400 max (I think if I remember correctly). I'm definitely trying those next. \n\nFor shortcut meals Lailaty has always been my no-risk go-to place. Kutumbari is on that list as of now *happy sigh*!",

If you think you  can just go there and order some snacks and drinks like its a regular food court, you sir, are wrong. We tried to order some stuff summing up to 400/-, but failed miserably, the waiter telling us with december chill in his voice \"you can't order just these things, you have to order a main course -_- . you HAVE TO order some main course, even if its 5 in the afternoon and you're not hungry (and not looking for dimly lit rooms).\nI can only imagine what they'll charge for those rooms :/\nLoved their dipping sauce though, i think it was a cilantro/coriander lime dip, with some acidity in it that suits me well.",

  "Place: Extra-Time, Cart Station, 3/A\nOrder: \nChicken Tortilla 120/-\nExtra Jalapeno 15/-\n\nReview:\nDropped in at Chips n' Gravy at The Cart Station, when I spied a new installment in the backyard. Curiousity dragged me to Extra-Time, a tortilla wrap serving food stop, on its second day of launch today. And doing pretty good business if I say so, what with the constant orders incoming. \n\nCuriousity does kill the cat, you know, it got better of me and I put in an order for Chicken with extra Jalapeno at 135/- total. A pretty decent price for the good looking wrap taking shape on their counter. Lots of chunky chicken with a choice of Dipper (sauce) ranging from Mayo, BBQ, Cheese to Chilli. I obviously went with the Cheese Tease Dipper. And the end result was a toasty tortilla wrap like a turnover full of Chicken and salad with a smoky zing from that tortilla itself. And quite yummily filling too. Especially for light eaters... Will have to try the steak version next for sure. \n\nOnly thing I'd say is that it needs the choice of more spice, more heat and chilli. And it's Ready to Roll (pun intended)! üòä\n\nMeanwhile got talking to the guy. Pretty decent, knowledgeable bloke with flying aspirations. At the way he's running, he probably will In Sha Allah.\n\nBut I love the fact that my part of town now has another different food stop completely worth a shot for Food Explorers, Yay Dhanmondi!!!",

It is an attractive cafe with good coffee, but we found the bakery goods uninspiring and the \"breakfasts\" are a rather unappetizing mish-mash of various items on a plate, including cold mashed potatoes.  There are no fresh juices, which is also surprising for an establishment that serves \"breakfast\" (I put it in quotation marks because the cafe only opens at 10 am).  The meal for two was over Tk 2000, so not only is it unmemorable, it is also not cheap.",

  "1. Steamed rice with Basil Beef Curry - It is my custom to order beef with basil in any restaurant that serves it. In my opinion, this is the second best beef with basil in Dhaka. Just enough garnish and salt and basil, but the gravy could have been a bit more. Moreover, the steamed rice was horribly bland and the gravy failed to create a delectable combo. Most importantly, 400+tk for just a two-item meal is very, very sub-par. Especially when you do not live upto the customer's least expectations.\n\n2. Rye Bread Sandwich (at Sub Factory) - My significant other is a gourmet. She savored every bite of the sandwich. The amount of meat is concentrated in the center, putting up the illusion that they were stingy when you take your first bite. Quite good for 125tk.\n\n3.

  "Today the weather was so perfect, winter knocking on the door. So after a horrible day at work my darling best friend thought of taking me out for dinner. He let me pick the restaurant and me being the most indecisive picked Luams but when we went there at 6:35 they said they will open at 7, sharp at 7. My heart broke into pieces but then I thought to try Hakka Dhaka and went there. They said they will start taking the order at 7 too but we can sit. So my tired & hungry soul gave up and wanted to sit and wait. We requested to take our orders before 7 cause we were starving to death . The waiter was nice and he took our order . We ordered platter A for 1300tk (two person). \n\nWe waited for around 30 mins then first the chicken wings came , there was 4 pieces and tasted awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee‚Ä¶. If I was home I would have licked the plate‚Ä¶. Sauce was perfect‚Ä¶ Then arrived the main course, Noodle were okay (I didn‚Äôt like that very much) but all the other items were awesome , Prawn was a bit smelly but tasted great.. Hunan chicken wassss yummy , loved it‚Ä¶ Hot and sour beef was really hot but tasted heavenly ‚Ä¶ In one word the food was worth waiting for‚Ä¶. The amount was generous‚Ä¶ We were both very full.. And unlike other chinese or thai restaurants they mentioned its indian chinese (Modified chinese) not real chinese ..We loved the food and hoping to go back soon‚Ä¶. I would rate 7.5/10 (one of my best ratings).\nSorry for the bad picture , we were starving and my shitty phone camera‚Ä¶.",

The sauce was good, albeit not very smooth, as I would have preferred. The jacket potato was perfect. But the sour cream (i think that's what its supposed to be) on top of it lacked the creaminess and flavour. The veggies were perfect! \nHad shrimp cocktail too. Forgot to take a pic. But sure was good.\nNice ambiance.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Will go back to taste the steak and fish and chips.",

  "Tried a new place \"Burger Jerks\" at The Cart Station in Dhanmondi. I had the chef's special Moroccan Chicken Steak Burger for 220tk. Here's my review:\nThe chicken was perfectly cooked. Usually chicken breast tends to become quite dry when grilled but they nailed it. It was quite juicy and well-seasoned. The condiments and sauces had a great balance. And the cherry on top was that I could taste the meat till the last bite. However, I would have loved it more if the bun was slightly more  crispy. I'd gladly rate this a 8.5/10.\nThe pic is collected from their page since I forgot to take a photo",

  "Place : Chips n' Gravy @ The Cart Station\n\nItem : Poutine (Roast Chicken)\nPrice : 250\n\nIngredients : Chicken gravy, Shredded Roast Chicken, Crispy  Chips, Paneer Cheese & Mushroom\nOverall Taste : 2\nChip's Quality : 2\nCheese Quality : 1 \nChicken and Mushroom Quality : 6\nGravy Quality : 3\nPresentation : 6\nService : 2\nAtmosphere : 7\nValue : 3\n\nPoutine is known as an ultimate comfort food but the one that we were served was nothing like that. \nFirstly, no offense but 'Chips' tasted like potato fries made by our housemaid. They had brownish texture and tasted nothing like what we expected. We had the opportunity to look at the  chips before they went in the gravy and they looked pretty dull. We didn't expect crispy chips as from past experience we know chips in a Poutine  supposed to be mushy. I have no idea why their advertisement says 'Crispy Chips'.\n\nCheese!  We just can't  call that 'Paneer Cheese'. My mother-in-law makes paneer for me and I love them. What they used in the gravy was nothing but Dhaka Cheese, which is found in or outside every super shops and markets. We always eat Dhaka cheese cuz it's really cheap compared to the other ones(imported). We never expected them to serve such cheap quality cheese.\n\nThe chicken and gravy  was well cooked but we couldn't taste the chicken at all. Because, they used mushroom which had an odd taste and was really over-powering. Every single spoon from that dish had 1/2 mushroom in it. Don't get us wrong, we love mushroom. Back in the days, I used to cook a lot of mushroom for us. I use to make two different dishes only containing  mushrooms as main ingredient. I don't want to brag but, all of my friends used to love my mushroom dishes. So, I am assuming that their mushrooms were not fresh at all.\n\nPresentation was a little average, nothing special. \n\nService was really poor. After giving our order, we waited half an hour. Then, I lost patience and went over to the cart just to find out that they don't  have my order. They asked me, 'Who took your order?'. I was shocked and couldn't reply.  Suddenly a woman who seemed to be one of the owner, appeared from nowhere and asked me  'What did you order son? Is it Poutine ?'.  I said 'Yes mam, with mushroom' . She then asked me to go back inside and wait a few minutes more. I went back with a heavy heart. We waited another 15 minutes before the guy who took our order brought our food with a smile. He apologized saying, 'Sorry, I had to go to mosque for Namaz.'.\n\nThey have seating arrangement outside but it's being colonized by flies. Fortunately, they have sitting arrangement  inside too which was rather clean and peaceful.\n\nMe and my other half both love food. We constantly search for different food. As a result, sometimes we do get disappointed but it never holds us down. As an ex McDonald's manager, I do understand that service can go bad when it's really busy, but food quality totally depends on the owners/management.  When we went there, they had only 1 customer. So, overall we were not pleased with their food and service at all.  \n\nUnfortunately, we will have to go there again, but certainly for Madchef !",

But after dinner at Lailaty, I was craving something sweet and the Falooda in the menu was calling to me! Falooda it was. \n\nAnd my, was it a Lovely Surprise or what to find they do it with sweet yoghurt too!! Yum Yum! It looked mouthwatering when It came to our table and all that Jelly and Tapioca was blinging at me. The first spoonful was pure delight, although a word of warning, that yoghurt is Ah-Mazingly Thick and Creamy and Thick! It was a perfect blend of Sweet Yoghurt, Fleshy Grapes, Creamy Jelly and Tapioca! There was banana in it too, unfortunately for me. It was a Good Falooda although still not as good as Star and a little less sweet, especially at the bottom. \n\nDon't eat up all the Yoghurt at first go though, Mix it well in scoops that go all the way to the bottom and you won't be left slurping watery Tapioca in the Last Bite lol!

  "Just my opinion.\nRecent days the food companies/ carts/ restaurants have been making continuously mistakes for food hygiene issue. No doubt for the last several months/ years foodies around Dhaka/ Bangladesh has raised a good number. so as their food business. \nThat's the reason Cafe Appeliano - te manush er line diye seat booking rekhe 20 min wait kore khete hoto, ignoring their short space. I had been their regular customers from last year November. But I  stop from today.\n\nThis is their carelessness they have made and if they are not made realized what they are doing, they won't purify themselves- may be this is our nature in every sector.  We don't pay less to them, we go to good shops for quality food. not to get those Lizards/ Pins/ Hair piece in foods. But this is happening in good shops, pathetically true. Man deserves 2nd chances, but we people deserve punishment as we never purify ourselves without it.\nI guess- WE Should find the carts/ shops/ restaurants through foodbanks and stop visiting as much as we can.  Other Good shops should also realize -in no means quality should not be degraded.  \n\nDefinitely- they will have good business if they serve well. But if they don't I think it shouldn't.",

  "Went to Albino, Jamuna Future Park yesterday with a friend.  we ordered their chicken cashew nut salad. It was a horrible experience! the cashew nuts had a very bad smell and were chewy. so it was pretty obvious that they were old and stale. they put on some kind of chicken gravy, more like \"murgir torkarir jhol\" which made the salad way too spicy and it tasted absolutely disgusting. the chicken pieces were okay, not as crunchy as it should be. \nafter eating a little, my tummy kind of started burning. we called the waiter and told him about the food. his reply was, \" mam, chicken chicken cashew nut salad erokom e hoy, and walked to another table\" :O\nwe had nothing more to say. we payed the bills and came back home. and now guess what? i am suffering from food poisoning. couldnt even go to work. and my friend vomited right after going home yesterday.

  "*OffTopic:\nDear Foodbankers.. It‚Äôs great to see the restaurants showing their affection to street children. I hope they‚Äôll also come forward during the upcoming winter and keep aside a part of their profits for the poor too. We those who are consuming those products at will should do our part too by sacrificing that one slice of cheesecake, a platter or going out for a buffet for a day and spend the amount for the upcoming winter.\n\nWinter is Coming!\nHad a few things to share from my past experience thought it would be useful, here they are:\n(sorry for the long post)\n\n1. Deadline: It is a tendency amongst people in our country to start working the night before deadline, be it office works, projects or assignments. This is one area where if you start working before the deadline i.e. deep into the winter many people will already be dead by then or struck by severe cold/fever. The sole purpose of this post was due to my disappointments of working and observing past organizers who think of holding a campaign in December, then collection ends at the very end of the month; arranging logistics takes up another few days then finally in mid January after almost 2 months of suffering they receive warm clothes. Whereas, if it all started in say early November it actually would have been fruitful. We urban dwellers feel the chill of winter a lot later compared to those in the remote of areas, especially due to dense population in cities like Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet. So keep in mind of those who don‚Äôt have a roof above their head when you are thinking of holding such events,winter starts pretty early for them!\n\n2. Scale Economies: A very basic concept taught in introductory level economics. When I‚Äôm talking about economies of scale I‚Äôm mostly emphasizing on technical economies for instance there are usually many people organizing winter drives but what happens is the hire small pickup trucks and even those are not always full of clothes, rather if many organizers or institutions join in a 5 tonne truck can be rented out and huge piles of clothes can be accommodated saving cost and time. Often many organizations come up with banners of their campaigns as CSR or advertisement strategy/exposure. Why not join in hands with other 10 firms and contribute in something bigger (just put logos of all 10 organizations seen in sponsored events). Often debate, business and other clubs in Universities are arranging such events too, why not collection of all clubs are piled up together and then distributed. Well many might say decentralization is actually better as it reaches more people, well its subjective and just my inputs regarding the matter.\n\n3. Organizing a disciplined event: Usually these campaigns are mostly covered in weekends so try holding the event in local schools/colleges when they are closed, better if there is an open field outside the premise. It is often observed that maintaining queues can be quite chaotic and volunteers lose their head, so here‚Äôs how it can be made a little better. It is best if all those who will be donated can be asked to stay inside a premises and the distribution can be done by placing the vehicle with warm clothes adjacent to the building. One more thing(if done in open fields) try and make a structure out of bamboo from funds collected that will help keep the line straight. Make two such lines: one for women, children and the aged the other for young and men.\n\nP.S. You can put your thoughts regarding the matter as well. \nLet‚Äôs start early, Cheers!\n\n~Rifat Ahmed Bin Zakir~",

  "Went to HAKKA DHAKA last night. It is quite a tiny restaurant with 5-6 tables. They offer two platters, A and B. One of the waiters recommended us to try their Chicken Wings as starters and try the Hunan Chicken & Garlic Prawn from the main course. So we ordered the 'platter A' (half- serves two) which included:\n\n-Chicken Wings\n-Hakka Noodles\n- Egg Fried Rice\n-Hunan Chicken\n-Hot & Sour Beef\n- Chilli Garlic Prawns &\n- Drinks\n\nThe Chicken Wings were dripped in sauce. Especially the flavors of soya sauce and garlic were coming out pretty good from the wings. Definitely these were some of the best wings I have ever had. Among the main course the Hunan Chicken, Beef & Garlic Prawn were all quite good too. They made it extra spicy for us as we requested. The fried rice was full of flavors but the Chowmein is Okk-ish. The quantity they serve is actually more than enough for two people. We loved all the items. And most importantly all of this for only 1300tk, (including VAT & Drinks) is a very good deal according to me. The half platter is 1300/=  serves 2 people and the full platter is 2500/= serves 4 people. Would definitely recommend everyone to try it. \n\nGreat job Hakka Dhaka!\nLocation: Banani, Road 10\n\nMy Ratings:\n----------\nPrice: 1300/= (all inclusive) [Serves TWO] Reasonable Pricing\nGood value for money.\nGreat Hospitality.

The bun really did tasted like chocolate a bit and it was really soft too. \n\nThe Patty: The patty was really soft and meaty aswell so no complain there.\n\nOther Ingredients: There was bit of everything in there but I couldn't tell them apart. I saw some mushrooms and that's about it. \n\nTaste: It tasted alright nothing out of ordinary but if you want a different looking burger which doesn't taste bad then you should really give it a go. I would rate it 7/10 for being different and not taste like shit at the same time. \n\nService: There wasn't any other people when we went there thus service was pretty fast. Took them around 10 mins for 3 burgers.\n\n[I hope the amount of information is adequate for you guys to visit the place or not]",

You guys have been coming up in a regular basis. Helping us to establish as a brand! Making new friends and so on! We love to see cyclists coming up to our cart, parking their cycles just beside our cart, grabbing our foods, laughing, gossiping blah blah! Legit in deed! This bunch of enthusiastic young fellows have been helping us from the very beginning with their continuous suggestions and support! This energetic crowd has always promoted our brand and helped us to leverage it! Even we have got a huge support while opening up our new cart at Banani! It makes us feel good to grow together and we are doing so! We have a special discount of 10% for any cyclists who ever comes up with cycle! Though that discount is nothing in comparison with the support you guys give us! This post is nothing but just to show an honor to this amazing crowd we have! And those of you who hasn't visited our Banani cart yet, I would say no matter which part of the city you belong, do visit our cart, as I believe distance is never a big deal cause you have your 2 wheels! Thanks again! Keep in touch! Come, eat & adda em all!\n\n-Enaab Karim, on behalf of WIFI STREET FOOD",

Plus the tartar sauce was creamy and the lemon slice was an excellent touch (i would like a thicker slice of lemon for so much fish tho) quantity 9/10 for me and quality 7/10 the fish needed a little bit more salt to take out a tiny bit of that after taste.

I believe many of the dig out spots in Dhaka are ripping you (and me) off just by vugi chugi (not all, of course)\n\nIf you had a menue at a resturent  and liked it, please, PLEASE search youtube and I ensure you will find many decent recipies to make the food at home for 1/8th of the money you pay.\n\nI, personaly had nothing in Dhaka that I can or could not reproduce at home (some traditional birianis and stuffs are out of the list).\n\nIf you pay 1500+, make sure it worths. If they say \"grilled\" and serve \"fried\", ask them \"why?\". If they say \"baked\" and serve \"boiled\", ask them. And ofcourse you can learn the terms within minutes from the internet. If you understand your food, the pleasure increases many folds.\n\nThanks for your time and sorry for the lengthy post. Bill has arrived. My first and last bill in Jamuna Future park for sure.\n\nNo hate, just advise.",

  "Place: CandyFloss Dhanmondi\nOrder: \nCheese Hot Dog 95/-\nChilled Lemonade 35/-\nMasala Soda 50/-\nAmbience: Never matters to me 'cause I believe in food speaking to me rather than the ambience. Pictures I can take anywhere and any other time. \n\nReview:\nCheese Hot Dog. Hmm do you see the Cheese? I didn't either. Or even taste it. I should have got the Ice Cream Soda instead (recent addition to thr menu and pretty good for 75/-)! *sigh*\n\nThe best thing about Candyfloss is their drinks. They are pretty awesome, if a bit inconsistent sometimes (maybe in a twice out of 12 times ratio). I love anything sour. And the Lemonade is a brilliant thirst quencher and perfect for a midday drink. The Masala Soda is another gorgeous drink. It tastes a lot like Zeera Pani but tonnes better and fresher. And for that price, anytime!\n\nI've been frequenting Candyfloss for their drinks since they opened up in my office yard months ago. But today I review due to a strange occurence this time which put a dampener on Candyfloss. Now, you guys are aware Candyfloos does a 10% discount for a FoodBank check in. I've never checked in here before so gave it a shot and showed it at the counter. And guess what? The bloke goes, \"Apu ekta bhalo picture post korte hobe naile amra discount dei na\", and myself - total ‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶≤! Anyways, I did so and decided to never even dream of a check in at Candyfloss again and just stick to my drinks which don't need one as they are quite affordable. Never seen this bloke here before. Hope I don't again lol. \n\nAdios Amigos CandyFloss Food!",

Before you try this, remember to tell the server if you do not like cucumber/tomato/mayo or anything in the sandwich.  They make it made to order/according to ur taste. \n2. Mango Raspberry chiller/freezer and strawberry/raspberry chiller/freezer. I had both! They just refresh you like anything.\n3. Cheesecake Brownie: As always the yummiest! Half belgian chocolate and half cream cheese! Oh! Bliss!!\n4. Regular Brownie: One of the best in Dhaka! Fudgy and moist.\nThe SURPRISE was the RED VELVET CUPCAKE!

Whether it's Food (Quality & Quantity) or Service. Anywhere else in the world this chain would be a mid level dining. But here in Bangladesh it very deservingly falls into the category of Fine Dining. Till date no other chain (Nando's *scoff* has a lesson to learn here) has been able to maintain this level of consistency. So Hats Off to the finest dining in town! \n\nPotato Wedges were crispy and heavenly with that Cheese dip. And our waiter was way too sweet. After supplying mayo a couple times, he brought us a substantial tub of it üòÜ in the end. \n\nMinnestrone is one of my all time favourite soups. They did a pretty good job with their version if it. An it was even better with all the Parmesan we piled on at every spoonful. \n\nMy Cheesy Bites was divine as always with the cheesiest and crustiest morsels ever. \n\nAll in all, an excellent meal.

Bbq chicken might not be for everyone as it's on the sweeter side due to the sauce,  but definitely worth a try for someone who likes bbq sauce.  I would say it was a good experience overall and will definitely visit again.",

  "Last day of the offer at Entree.\n\nThe booking was made six days in advance for Friday at 5 PM, and this was the most anticipated meal we have ever had. However, we were wary, in light of the recent negative reviews here in Foodbank.\n\nWe went there 10 minutes early and were seated almost immediately to a table of our preference. We had to change tables because there was a spring sticking out of a sofa that was uncomfortable to sit on.\n\nThe place was sparsely populated and quiet. The ambience was decent, albeit the music a little too loud and not what should be played at a restaurant. Though, after 2/3 requests, they turned the music down. I'd have given a +1 to service if it didn't take so many requests.\n\nThe menus were given and the food order taken at the right time. The food, pictured below, appeared within 10 minutes. I have to award points both for the swiftness of the service and for the food's presentation.\n\nThe steak was moist inside and out. It was just the right shade of pink on the inside, just like a Medium-to-Well steak should. The meat melts in mouth. The mashed potato and grilled/saut√©ed veggies complement that meat to perfection. That was the best steak I have ever had.\n\nI remember someone in Foodbank complaining that their steak was too hard to cut/chew. Well, if you order it Well-Done and eat it last while it gets cold, don't complain.\n\nThere were two rather large pieces of chicken, of two different favours. Both were very moist and packed with flavour. It's hard to say which one I liked more.\n\nWe asked for Tabasco and BBQ sauce and were readily provided. Service has always been swift and friendly.\n\nWe took our sweet time in savouring every bite as this ended up being the most satisfying meal in recent memory. Thanks to Entr√©e Caf√© Lounge for a wonderful experience.\n\nMy ratings:\n\n* Price: At 688/= with VAT, it was a steal. Excellent value for money.\n\n* Ambience: 7/10. \n  Can be improved with more comfortable chairs and better music.\n\n* Service: 9/10.\n\n* Food: 10/10. Solid.",

  "this heavenly little piece of paradise once used to be a whole beautiful cake but then mankind couldn't handle such elegance and beauty so most of it was devoured. I was trusted by the higher power to protect and cherish the last piece but alas I succumbed to my mortal and earthly desires. Nothing will ever come close to the enchanting sonnet it plays in your cavity. The  cheese creamy texture in the contrast with the voluptuous blueberries is unmatched by others. The biscuit layer so texturally refined stood it's ground as an equal. And last the white chocolate cream on top was felt like the gentle cleansing foams Aphrodite herself rose from when she came from the Sea. Having this cheesecake made me question the good things I have done in my past life to have the honor of dining on this piece of perfection. It was from the mighty Cheesecake Factory, sorry my back camera can't focus.",

  "went to Bread & Beyond banani, today to have some coffee. while we were enjoying our coffee, a woman entered the store and asked for brown bread. the barista politely told her that yes they have brown bread but it was manufactured yesterday, and same case is for white bread. he also explained that both of those have shelf life till 5th and 6th of this month respectively though. and he apologized for not being able to provide her with fresh product. \ni am simply amazed and happy to see such customer service from a small coffee shop. and the barista was really well educated, and knows his coffee very well (explained us our orders very briefly).\n\nLet's come to food, took hazelnut latte, french vanilla latte, dry cappuccino and brownie. my french vanilla latte had a soothing vanilla flavor hint which was not overpowering the taste of coffee , the brownie was good enough, had lots of nut (unfortunately i dont like nuts, so didn't enjoy it) . \nwill definitely go back again for coffee.\nRating \nFood: 7.5/10 (which is pretty good as i'll rate north end as 8.5, so you got the standard) \nService: 9.5/10 (Absolutely top notch)\nAmbiance: 7 (the store is pretty small but cozy enough)",

  "I became a big fan of Thanda Garam around last year when i first tried their amazing juices at the Nikunjo-2 outlet. Unfortunately that closed down but they recently opened in Gulshan-2 about a month back [on the road beside Persona OR Apex building, opposite of the former Wonderland]. Every time i am in the vicinity i make it a priority to drop by. I was never an avid juice fan but once i tried their juices it dawned on me that i might be wrong. Take one sip of their free testers and you will know what i mean. You will get a wide variety of juices all year round starting from \"Jalpai\", \"Kacha Aam\" ,\"Lichi\" ,\"Lemonade\",\"Kamranga\" and etc etc etc. Hell you even get a different twist of \"Lassi\". You can choose from about 25 options on their menu serving in three sizes (150,225,335 ml) and the pricing is very very reasonable compared to what they are serving. 150 ml glasses range from about Tk. 50-80 while the 350ml goes in the range of about Tk.125-160 My Personal favorite is the \"Gira Pani\", a blend of Lemon Water, Spices and Gira and it is a true refresher !!!! \nIf you work/live or hangout in the vicinity do drop by and try these mind boggling and refreshing fresh Juices.",

Asked for fries. No fries. Asked for Fanta. No Fanta. Oh-Kay then.\n\nOrder finally arrives. And with fries O_o (?) They were okay burgers. Just seemed a lot less so than the last time. The Double Decker was a bit dry. I hate Ketchup on Burgers and I had to dunk mine in it so I could swallow. It went down dry. And the wings were served in Gravy!!

But after careful evaluation and also from other people's opinion, I strongly want to stand against any product of PRAN. There has been television & newspaper reports showing evidence of the unhygienic conditions these products are made from, but still Pran product is found everywhere. I am particularly concerned about their children's food product like candies, flavored milk and juices which were all proven to be of very low and inferior quality. This post is just an outcry to all of you to join my voice to boycott all Pran products, because the only way they are still surviving is because some of us are still buying it in ignorance!",

There were several main dishes like jeera rice, butter chicken, achaari beef, makhani sabji, daal makhani and lots more. As desserts they had gajar ka halwa, firni and dahi. The desserts were to die for! Loved their food to the level extreme. Pure indian flavour. Great interior and ofcourse good food! \nPrice: 599++ per person. \nRating: 10/10!",

  "Went to Entr√©e Caf√© Lounge to try their promotional platter offer. Considering the price, food was pretty good. Huge quantity, quality wasn't bad either. My complain is the service. Series of events follows...\n\nGot a seat after waiting for 20 minutes. Business is going strong!!\nWaited another 10 minutes just to get someone to wait on us.\nOrdered 2 platters (1 medium and 1 well-done) and 2 drinks for the 2 of us.\nWas pleasantly surprised when the waiter brings us food within 10 minutes.\nTurns out, it was just the well-done platter, not the medium one.\nThe waiter assures me the other platter is on its way.\nWaited another 10 minutes before we got cutlery! Still no drinks or platter.\nReminded the same waiter about our order 3 times over the next half hour, every time he asked what the order was!!!\n40 minutes after we got the first platter, we get the second platter and the drinks!! My well-done platter is finished, and my girl just got her plate!\nWe decide to pack up the food and leave. I called the waiter for the check and to pack the food.\nAfter another 15 minutes, we finally get the packed food, but still no check.\nAfter waiting 10 more minutes for the check, I decided to go up to the counter. It took them atleast another 5 minutes to make the bill!!\n\nThanks Entr√©e for a disastrous lunch date!\n\nMet one of the owners on the way out. If you are reading this, I would suggest you fire that particular waiter, because he seemed super-confused throughout our 1.5 hr ordeal. He seemed to have no idea how he got there, let alone provide service to customers.\n\nFood - 7/10\nPrice - 9/10\nService - (neg)10/10",

But the salad in the combo pack was laughable. It was definitely not worth 89 bucks, the smaller food joints in this area give much more for free. Overall was disappointed. Will not go back.",

Don't know the price of the juice.\n\nReview:\n> The soups were not that good. They weren't that thick. Lacked taste and were a bit too watery.\n\n> I loved the Dal Makhani the most and the Jeera rice was really good. The other main dishes were good.\n\n> The grilled items were good too. The chutneys complemented the grilled items nicely. The naan was good.\n\n> The desserts disappointed me. They weren't sweet enough. The Firni didn't have the right texture and consistency. The plain curd was almost tasteless.\n\n> The place looks really nice. I liked the interior decoration and the place as a whole.\n\nRating:\n> Food: 8.5/10\n> Place: 9/10\n\nI would still recommend you to go there because the main dishes are good enough to ignore the imperfections of the desserts and soups.\n\nIf you love Indian cuisine like me, then you should go there!

  "After seeing a few people posting about it here, I decided to try out Entree's BBQ Platter and review it. So here goes, it's priced at Tk 599 exclusive of VAT, and this is a promotional offer which is valid till the 3rd of October. Included in this platter are 1 T-Bone Steak, 1 Charcoal Chicken, 1 BBQ Chicken, Grilled Vegetables, Mashed Potato and French Fries. I didn't like the fries as they were a bit too soggy and limp for my taste. The Grilled Vegetables and Mashed Potato were really good. All 3 of the meat dishes were really good but the Steak was a tad too dry for me without any sauce or gravy but otherwise tasted good enough. Best item on the platter for me was the BBQ Chicken without a shadow of a doubt. It had a nice smoky BBQ flavor with a hint of spice behind it. The Charcoal Chicken was pretty good as well. Overall this platter is really good and can satisfy the full extent of the appetites of most gluttons (such as myself :P) and this promotional price is really good value for money and gives a good account of what Entree is truly about. I would recommend this platter and place to all FoodBankers and would advise you to go there and enjoy the promotional offer while you still can. Thanks for reading my long-winded review and special thanks to the people in the group who posted about this and brought it to my attention!",

They take me for a Fool of course! They tell me that it's not Nail, it's the partial head of the Habenero Chilli they use in their recipes. They think I don't even know what Habenoro is, let alone that it's Chilli. That was the ultimate Moronic bottom of the night. As I was too quick to call the server, I have no photos.

  "Hi foodbankers,\n\nSo this is my second review on Foodbank; go easy on me. Last time some of you were brutal to my review which hurt my emotions. Anywho, that's a long gone story‚Ä¶..here's a foreign restaurant that I went to recently and am about to review.\n\nBefore I rush into this, let me ask you a question (which I am sure you have pondered over before) - what kind of meat do people in the Pokemon world eat? Look no further, because last week I was in Japan and this age old query was answered - they eat Pokemon meat, Duh!\n\nMy Japanese friends were kind enough to indulge me at a fine dining Pokemon cuisine which was located right at the heart of Naruto and Hentai intersection. The staff members were dressed professionally in classy black tops and formal tentacles as bottoms and greeted us warmly. The interior was lively and we were escorted to our tables by the most hospitable waiters. \n\nTheir menu was vibrant and I ordered the following (along with review and pictures I took with my camera):\n\nAppetizer: ‚ÄòCharmander tail sizzler‚Äô - this dish was a complete killer - an amazingly hot dish. Those of you who haven‚Äôt seen a Charmander before, there's always a bit of fire burning at the tip of Charmander‚Äôs tail and this is the icing on the cake. Here‚Äôs why - you know how meat tastes better the longer it is marinated and cooked slowly. Now think about that fire on Charmander's tail, which means that the frikking pokemon was being slowly cooked since its birth without even its knowing. Science bitch! Another amazing thing about a lizard's burning tail dish is the cheap high it got me. Reminded me of my good old days in Kalachadpur, where I used to burn and eat tiktikir lej......nostalgia....sigh!\n\nMain courses: ‚ÄòEvolving Pikachu Burger‚Äô and ‚ÄòPikachu Nasi Goreng doused in peri peri Bulbasor sauce‚Äô - these dishes were rich, vivacious and poetic. You know how certain parts of beef are so tender and need no external oil for cooking because they cook in their own rich fat? Pikachus are great in this way because - would you believe it - they can be cooked in their own rich electricity! And here‚Äôs another cherry on top‚Ä¶.an evolving Pikachu burger is made out of a Pikachu that is killed right before it evolved into a bigger Raichu. So how‚Äôs that any good - the burger actually evolves into a much bigger, swelling chunk of Raichu meat burger on your plate ‚Äì all veiny, pulsating and throbbing!! The menu also mentions that the ‚ÄòEvolving Pikachu Burger‚Äô is a celebrity favorite. Sasha Grey had it and said that nothing turns her on more than having meat that enlarges at the tip of her tongue.\n\nDessert: Pikachu Faluda: This cute colorful dish was so alive, it almost spoke to me, no, it did seriously! It‚Äôs one of those wtf semi alive oriental dishes where Pikachu is half alive and half sacrificed to the Cthulhu Gods to bring good virility to men. It was so frikking half alive that as I stabbed my chopsticks through its soft goodness, I could even hear it say ‚ÄúI live to serve your palate‚Äù‚Ä¶..it also could‚Äôve been ‚ÄúI‚Äôll burn your family‚Äù but what do I know‚Ä¶.all I heard was gasping of ‚Äòpika pika pii fook you‚Äô!\n\nSo all in all, I‚Äôll give this place a 9/10 and a bonus 2 for the evolving Pikachu to Raichu burger. So many discoveries in one restaurant trip‚Ä¶.still begs one question though.....are pokemons named after the noise they make, or do they say what they say because it‚Äôs their name?......Cheers\n\nSummary ‚Äì Super recommended.",

The flavours are sublime and amazing.\nSub cyrus: filled to the rim with chunky chicken, saut√©ed mushrooms and onions and their homemade hot sauce. The bread was soft and the sub was very flavourful. \nChocoshake: Amazing and very addictive chocolate milkshake that u don't wanna stop drinking!\nFood: 12/10\nService: 12/10\n\nThis small cafe really impressed me with their quality food in large quantities and also the hospitality offered by the employees there!

Pasta Basta & Italiano tasted so blunt that my friends couldn't even finish it! It looked yuumm but tasted pale with a good amount of meat in it.\n\nBut yeah, Pasta Appeliano could easily compete with Shawrma House. All of us loved the spicy, cheesy & tangy flavor of that! \n\nAmbiance was okay considering it was way too congested & sofas were torned out. Service was outstanding & friendly. & yeah, quantity of food is wholesome!\n\nOverall my rating would be:\nPasta Basta - 5/10\nPasta Italiano - 2/10\nPasta Appeliano - 8.5/10\nService -10/10\nEnvironment - 7/10\n\nSince it's really close so my home, would definitely go back there for Pasta Appeliano alone :) (if I can convince my friends to go again :P )",

Though they were very less in number, most of them had good reputation for their food and service. I would like to mention a few names: Vintage ( the one that was in the place of the skin care centre at sobahanbagh), wimpee and few others whose names i don't remember. Today, after 6 or 7 years, we have uncountable number of places for eating out, hang out, family dinners. Sometimes we even get puzzled where to go or where not to go. In short more options than we can visit. Many of them are getting good responses from customers and some getting bad reviews too.Living in such a time of a revolution of BD food industry, i would like to know the views of fellow foodbankers. Though there are multiples eat out places now, are we getting the service or food up to the mark for the price we are paying? Though the industry has emerged a lot but could it hit an international standard? Overally where do you think the position of BD food industry is at the current scenario? :)",

Although I didn't get the Cheesecake Brownie, I ordered the Mango Yoghurt thing, Fudge Brownie, Oreo Shake and a Hazelnut Latte. The Oreo shake was amazing, Latte and brownie was okay. However, I could not understand what created such a hype about the Yoghurt Crumble! The yoghurt layer had no proper flavor. As the crumble and jello layer was so mild in taste, the yoghurt should have had a punch in it. They should have strictly concentrated on drinks/coffee and some decent snack to accompany them.\nBut I must also mention that the customer service was really great. They made us feel very welcomed!\n\nMy second experience of good service and great food was at North End. Amazing Brownies(although, a little too dense), delicious brewed coffee, Cinnamon Rolls and Pumpkin Cupcakes. To add a pleasant spume to it, they had wonderful service. Only because they were late in taking our order, the coffee was on the house and we were attended every now and then!\nThe whole point of this post is that it's a wonderful sign that Cafes in Bangladesh are working so successfully on their services but at the same time they should concentrate on improving few signature items rather than putting up various inferior dishes to fill up their menus!

The patties were much bigger and juicier the second time around, so I would recommend that you go as early as you can to get the best meat. \n\nYou know that feeling that you get when you‚Äôve had something spicy and the outside of your lips keep burning juuuuust a little bit? That‚Äôs basically how I‚Äôd describe the taste of this burger. My sister and I each took a bite, looked at each other to prove that it wasn‚Äôt hot at all (and that we were adults who can deal with a bit of spicy food)‚Ä¶ and then it kicked in after a few seconds. My sister and I promptly exchanged surprised looks and our eyes got a little big and we started to reach for a glass of water.\n\nIt‚Äôs a peppery, tangy kind of spiciness that might need a gulp or two of cold water to be dealt with, but is otherwise decent. The thick slices of paneer are easy to detect and really add to the flavor.\n\nIt basically tastes like a burger that your aunt or mother might have concocted one day when they were trying to impress their kids with their skills, with a bunch of deshi ingredients at hand ‚Äì and that isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing.\n\nService wasn‚Äôt exactly quick, but they were polite with me and repeated my order with a smile ‚Äì more than what I could have asked for. I waited in my car for my food to go, and I would recommend that you go there with a bunch of friends if you‚Äôre going to be late. The cart stays open until 4am, but the area gets pretty sketchy and quiet when the market right behind the cart shuts down. That‚Äôs the best thing though, isn‚Äôt it? IT STAYS OPEN UNTIL 4AM! I can‚Äôt think of many other places that stay open so late when I need me some comfort food.",

  "\"#Kulfi\" from Puran Dacca Restaurant. It was an usual random night when my family and I had this sudden urge to try \"Kulfi\" and we ended up to this restaurant. We ordered three, but they had only two left. Undoubtedly the presentation was very tempting but it tasted like a solid milk floured ice- bar. It was difficult to eat and we really couldn't finish it. Lastly, the disappointing part was to pay BDT 300/- for these.

Tasted some Srilankan dishes for the first time and the flavor was quite interesting. Most of the gravy items were cooked in coconut milk but I must say it won't repel your tastebud. The place is perfect for vegetable lovers as they offer varity of veg dishes. I would say for everyday dining you might not like it but once in a while for a change of taste, Royal Park is one of the best. I'm planning to hit the place again on Mongolian theme day :)",

Rather than Westin, Regency I would say if you are willing to pay a good price for your food, please go there. The steaks are tender, the prawns are succulent ( I ate 8 of them :p ) and the desserts are to die for. The best part is they keep on serving you mineral water which is free of cost. To me they just lacked one thing, they did not have any fried rice or chowmein item instead trey had a vegetable pulao. So yeah that will fill the flaw. Otherwise everything is superb Masha Allah.

Okay, not a \"big\" deal, we ordered  Pasta with Chicken and Prawn Hot Sauce, Pasta with Beef Meat Sauce, Spaghetti with Beef meat Sauce, Mexican Steak, Thai soup thick etc. (in total). As drinks, among the orders there were cold coffee, Cafe Hello three layer soft drinks and regular coke. They took over 50 minutes to serve the food.  We understand, in Eid time it is a bit to harsh to be so impatient for food because of the rush. We wouldn't count it if the waiting was well deserved because what came after waiting was a disaster. The three layer soft drink they served was not cold. And it was like a \"joke\" drink to me. We asked for ice and thought again- not a big deal. The white pasta was good, if I still go there for some unavoidable reason, this is the only dish I would trust. The beef pasta and beef spaghetti was just inedible. They mixed something that tasted like \"achaar\"  in large quantity which made it smelly and just uneatable. We just ate about 30-40% of it. Mexican steak was really disappointing in terms of both taste and quantity. Even Timeout serves lot better steaks at cheaper price than them. In thai soup it was a challenge to find pieces of prawns and chickens as they were incredibly low in amount. The cold coffee was not upto the mark as well.  The prices of foods were like this : Pasta around 350 tk , Steak around 700 tk, Soup around 190 tk per person, spaghetti around 330 tk, cold coffee around 220 tk , three layer soft drink around 65 tk etc (all including vat). \n\nAt the time of billing, I gently asked the waiter, \"look we have left 50% of  some items as they taste too bad, any explanations?\". The waiter said , at Eid time this can happen because of rush. I didn't think anymore, making complaints or suggestions had any point there, so just left the place.\n\nSome people recommended their Mexican dishes, but I have no more faith on Cafe Hello Dhanmondi. \n\n(2/3 randomly taken photos are included)",

  "So this is my very first review on foodbank. I don't usually write about how the food I eat tastes, but today I thought I should start. Today I ended up going to 27 Shrimp Avenue. I know its currently still going through a soft opening so I tried not to have my hopes too high. We ordered Crispy Rise Soup which was amazing, the shrimp tempura which was also good.\nNow for the bad news. I wanted to order something just with shrimp alone but The waiter kept on telling me that I would have to order a different rice item with the shrimp. Thus i ended up ordering a Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp and a separate rice item. Even though the Crispy Rise Soup and tempura was prepared quickly I had to wait quite a while for the lemon garlic butter shrimp to be ready. Finally after it arrived, I realized this lemon garlic shrimp comes with pasta on the bottom, thus there was no need to order the additional rice item which costs me extra and tasted like polao. I had ordered the beef sausage rice. The lemon garlic butter shrimp looked good, but was very tasteless, the seasonings didn't go inside the shrimp. The silverware and plates the food was served on looked to be very unclean. The price seemed a little too high but what was outrageous is that they charged me 170 taka for two Bangladeshi made coke cans. Since this is a soft opening, would request the owners to bring some changes. The restaurant has a lot of potential and I would be happy to come back if these changes are implemented.",

Bring your own kitchen towels and glass cleaner (Mr Brasso)\n6. Some of the chairs are partly made of glass, so you'll always have to feel butt awkward sitting on them.\n7.

And I told than I told them to clean the table they said they will.After saying 6 times that is after half n hour my table was cleaned Okay fine now I again called the waiter and asked where my order he was again like \" ashtese ektu wait koren\". After 15 more mins it got on my nerve and I got up and went to counter and asked \"bhai kotokon lage? amader ki 45mins lage ekta order server korte?\" was like kake order disen ektu wait koren\" achaa fine. The person I complained got vanished for 5mins -_- Than I complained to another person he was like ektu wait koren akoni dicchi ektu oppekha koren..he came back and I again said \" bhai ekta jaigai khaite aschi order disi order ashte ki 45mins lage? amar pore manush ashe order dicche and ora oder food pacche?\" he was like kake order deachen, ami bollam oi waiter k and he was calling the waiter but the waiter is so busy. The other person said ok wait koren. and brought the me wrong order and said aije food. Than I became angry and started behaving rude and tokon tara 2jon bhai sorry bhul hoyea gese  blah blah and I asked manager koi nai chutite ar kao ase manager niche nah nai.. pore I was like thak bhai rakhen apnar foods ami chole jajchi dont worry aitar bepare ekta review lekbo neh\" tokon he was like bhai bhai sorry akoni dicchi boshen extremely sorry! \n\nSo after waiting 1hr I had to leave without foods. The person i complained was good but the waiter I felt like slapping him. Now the thing is the authority needs to take a look at this very poor service. \nThe people beside my table got angry too as the waiter served the foods without cleaning the table. \n\nDhaba has great foods but poor service. I love the foods of dhaba but then again when I recall about their service I felt \"naaaaaah\" i rather go somewhere and eat. :/\n\nIf anyone knows the owner or anyone from dhaba please tag him/her.

  "I wish I knew where to start this review. The professional criticism in this group is reaching it's peak.\n\nThis is Miso Ramen and BBQ beef rice at Tekiya. To wrap them up in a nutshell this is easily the worst food I have ever had in my entire life.\n\nThere was no meat at all in the Ramen.  It tasted like Cocola noodles with shutki mach and pani would taste if they were mixed together a week ago and left to rot. Couldn't have any more than a spoonful.  Felt sick. So I had to abandon the \nRamen hoping the other dish would be better. \n\nIf by better one means having sweat beef and sticky rice, sure it was better. Coz I could actually finish.  Phew. \n\nIt didn't taste all that great but it was at least edible. \n\nThe beef portions were very miser and so was the rice. But anything would have tasted better after the Ramen disaster. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. \n\nThe price to satisfaction ratio is zero.\n\nThe dishes cost 420 tk and 400 tk respective ly. \n\nTalk abou ripoff eh? \n\nAnd the service is pretty poor. They couldn't arrange a seat for me and the service made me grow old. \n\nSo overall a disappointment. \n\nIf someone wants Japanese food, it's probably worth forking out some extra on Izumi. \n\nCheers to the owner mate. If you are reading this please make sure customers get a worthwhile experience. \n\nMany people visiting are newbies to Japanese food. And I am sure people will grow a dislike for Japanese food if they encounter something as horrible. And you might wanna revise the prices. Coz they are not even close to being realistic.  \n\nI was really disappointed.  But that's just me though. Others may like it.",

Wow!! It was a total waste of money.Ill give 4/10 n suggest evry1 to go there aft few months cz by that time they will have all the food in d menu n d service will b better,hopefully.Lastly went to cream & fudge.I took chocolate icecream with brownie topping & it was yumm.Ill give it 9/10.",

  "Based on all the comments and pictures about steak, it's pretty obvious that people love steak in this country..unfortunately the steaks you guys are raving about are either really bad cut of meat, over cooked, doused in some ketchup or sauce and expensive... Cooking steaks at home are a great option, it's easy, a lot cheaper and you get to choose the best cut that you like and you get to cook it to your taste...there are soo many places that offers great cuts like, dhali, white hen gourmet butcher and the price you pay for one in a restaurant you can actually get 2 or more pieces.. Cook some in your house and share your stories..",

The Irish Coffee was too sweet for me and had an almost bland taste! Overall I would still go to Kiva Han only because of their good service and ambiance. Hope that helps! :)",

  "Yesterday me and a friend went to cream and fudge Dhanmondi for having our favourite waffle ice cream. So we ordered two waffle ice creams and they charged around 650 including vat. First of all they took around 20 minutes to serve just two scoop of ice cream and then when I received the ice cream I was shocked! It was served in a one time cup. When I asked the waiter that I ordered waffle why did u give me this. He said without any hesitation AMADER EIKHANE EID E WAFFLE DEWA HOY NAH as if its a matter of pride to say. Though they charged me for the waffle too. Another guy also came in with the same complain but he was given the same excuse and he left in fury. \nThe amount of ice cream they gave cannot even fill a small bowl that we use to serve guests with ice cream. Sorry for no pictures since we couldn't click them coz of so much clumsy environment over there, we had to walk away with the ice cream. Overally it was a horrible experience. I give them 2/10 altogether. And I recommend New Zealand natural, they are way better than cream and fudge. :)\nPS: They dont have cones either during eid, according to the waiter! :/\ninternational Chain restaurants and ice cream parlour can easily be given the nickname of FOOD INDUSTRY TERRORISTS in the present scenario of BD. :/",

It reminded me of those big huge greasy pizzas you get around every corner in the US. The crust if not as puffy as a pan pizza but not really thin either. & the pizza was just oozing with cheese. So much cheese! The Supreme Pizza had pepperoni, mushrooms and capsicum. Its the kind of pizza that is like a big guilty pleasure.

I had the cheesecake layer separately and let me tell you all that cheesy is not cheese :P\nBut guys whether you have the brownie or the cheesecake brownie, its all the same. Tastes great.

I waited for like 45 minutes for my order and complained to them after I lost my patience. They apologized and served me my order right away. I ordered the cheesy delight and I found it quiet tasty. To my surprise when I was about to pay the bill after finishing my meal the guy who took my order came up and apologized once again and said 'we've just opened and there are a lot of customers . Please excuse our service. We've added a discount to your bill to make up for the inconvenience'. The discount left me smiling and I went home pleased.",

On Eid day, we would be open from 5pm up to 11pm. The day after Eid, we would open from 12pm to 11pm. \n\nWe are going to start with only 27 items and expand the menu later after the trial and based on your valuable input. We have tried to keep the special pricing as reasonable as possible, items range from Tk. 180/- to Tk. 450/-, except the Beef Steak which is Tk. 750/- \n\nPlease understand that this is a trial run. We are extremely understaffed due to Eid. There may be lapses in our service. Please excuse us for that. Your valuable feedback, kind support & understanding is of paramount importance to us. We do hope you would extend your kind support to our venture so that we can flourish to give you the best possible food & service.\n\nThank you & Eid Mubarak to you & your near & dear ones.\nSincerely,\nThe Management of 27 Shrimp Avenue",
  
  "We have a wonderful story about BBQ Bangladesh to share.\n\nLast night, after finding Tarka completely full (despite having reservations), we bailed and went to BBQ Bangladesh in Gulshan 2. We got there at 2:45am, found a table for four and ordered our food immediately ‚Äì TWO Korean Charbroiled Meals (one with a mashed potato side), ONE 10‚Äù Shrimp Gorgonzola Pizza and ONE 13‚Äù Combination Pizza. We also got a small jar of Green Apple-ade, a can of Mountain Dew and some water.\n\nFast forward to 3:35am and we had only been served the green apple-ade and water. Sehri time was running out fast, and about 4 other tables/parties were facing the same situation. We were all angry, and we vented our anger on the manager. He was incredibly stressed and told us that he was ‚Äúa failure.‚Äù However, we got our food right after the shouting match‚Ä¶ except the mashed potatoes ordered by our friend Manzur.\n\nWe thought they simply couldn‚Äôt prepare it and so we let it pass. However, after Sehri time was up and we were about to pay the bill, we saw that the mashed potatoes had indeed been charged. After pointing it out to the waiter, we expected the charge to get cut off.\n\nBUT, WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE ON HIS FACE, THE WAITER SERVED MANZUR THE SMALL BOWL OF MASHED POTATOES. This guy probably thought he was going to get a raise because of his ingenuity. Remember ‚Äì This tiny bowl was served AFTER SEHRI PERIOD WAS OVER! We were done eating. We were about to get up and pay off the bill. And then the moment in the picture happened.

The waiters were extremely rude. Didn't take any order properly. One of them left midway through the order, never came back to take the rest of the order. One of us ordered onion rings, we got it after 45 mins. And, to cap it off other tables kept getting their orders before us. None of the waiters apologized for their behavior or our food being delayed.

I didnt say a word since It was already 3pm and  most of my preferred restaurants were already fully reserved by then.\n It was around 5.50 pm when I called them again to re confirm and tell them not to cancel the reservation as I was on the way and will be reaching shortly with my family. That man asked my name of the reservation and said \" ok apnara ashtesen thikase kintu shudhu ashlei toh hobe na, order toh korte hobe menu theke, amder prepare korte hobe amrao toh iftar kori. Apnara ki eshe order korben naki deri korben abar..??\" I mean srsly???  That is how yr taught to treat yr damn customers?  Talking like some bloody truck drivers? Just Bcoz you're gonna serve yr million dollar worth food?\n I hung up and am still on the way towards it. I am out of words to express my anger but thekay pore jete hocche since we're helpless right now.\n Well let me tell u Tarka, you missed a bunch of customers.

  "BAD Iftar Experience @DOSA express, Bailey Road! \n\nFirst of all, we only went because we were late and there was nothing else that could accommodate us because their iftar platter was just plain boring. We asked specifically if they can serve from the regular menu and they confirmed that they can. We gave our orders but only 3 minutes before the azaan the malik  shouted at the waiter that 'only iftar platter at iftaar'! \n\nWe cancelled the other orders and asked for 1 (one) iftar platter and a mineral water. They started bringing our pre-orders WITH the Iftar platter, even though we cancelled it before! We asked them again and again to stop bringing the food, but they already served us chicken pakora (we had asked for paneer pakora) and a dosa. Not a single waiter came to the table no matter how many times we called them. And they couldn't even get us the water! \n\nIt was when I threatened to leave without paying that they came running and said that I have to pay for all the other stuff that we ordered because they were already 'ready'. Of course I wouldn't pay for the food I cancelled again and again, and weren't even on my table. I had to actually walk out, only paying for the food that they already sent over and we had to eat cause, well ... we were extremely hungry! \n\nThe bill was 900/- BDT for food we absolutely hated!

  "Village review : Worst Iftar experience till date. Firstly, the plates and dishes were not cleaned properly and full of scartches that you might thing it's being used since last 50 years! The table clothes were like in the condition of 3rd batch serving in bengali wedding ceremony. After seeing these condition we already lost half of our appetite...but when it came to food we were shocked to see the size of the food pieces (desert and main courses)! For a moment we felt like liliputs :S I've never seen Malteseres size mini dahi bara before. The pudding were cut in pieces smaller than a bite you can take. I know people waste food in buffet but come on! There is a decency in serving! The halim was prepared without meat or the meats were removed before serving. We were a group of 14 people and none of us got a single piece of meat in the halim! The drinks ( tang, molasses juice, ruh afza) were too diluted. We preferred water over drinks.overall taste of the food were below average. I took kebabish type of items mostly but couldn't finish half of it despite being hungry. It was not worth the money and time we spent!\nRating: 3/10",

  "The review is not about the food as we all know how awesome bbq Bangladesh is.\n\nBut few minutes back I came across a post in DSD where a girl had lost her iphone which she had left at Nandos. She also mentioned that incidents like this had happened before as well.\n\nHowever, when my friend had left her s4 at BBQ yesterday, the waiter came running after us with the phone. may Allah bless him.\nAlso, I must mention that he suggested us not to order the ade for takeaway as it would have not retained the same taste during iftar. We really appreciated his concern and honesty.\n\np.s. Tanim Ud Dowlah thanks for coming up with Korean Charboiled. I think i can never get bored of it. \nHowever, the paper bags were not available when we went there yesterday, and so we had to carry the food boxes on your hands :P",

  "Everyone is dying to go to ALRAZZAK...Why is that so ? Only to have shehri there!!? Which is not worthy a single penny.Seriously!!! An hour back I went there and had my shehri ,which was totally devasted my impression on AL RAZZAK. I know many of you guys will not agree with my post  but its totally my own opanion and I have the right to speak the truth here. Here I come ..I went there with my cousins and bro-in-law and had to wait there an hour to get the seats.There waiters were so arrogant  they forget that  they are just a simple waiter..Now it turns to Food ,their plates weren't clean much and food was so oily and unhealthy. I had to call more than 5  times to change the food because I found wire in the chicken and Prawn was so full of extra species. Somehow I just finished it and went out to wash my hands. Now they gave the bill and charged each baby Chicken 400tk whereas one of the waiter told a guy infront of me that each full big chicken would cost 350 taka . I asked him but he declined on my face!! Comeon you guys charge 400 of chicken and 60 taka of small mineral water and Our bill came 2200 where we only took 2 plates of Polao 3 full Chickens and 1 plate of Mutton. Wtf !!!! Atleast put some good new soap in the cleaning room.\n\nDears, I don't have any complain about their food qualities or the services. I just wanted to tell why you guys just so fasinated to go there,which is not worth  at all ,yes once in a while its fine but some people always love to sing their songs whereas they even dont know what they are singing. Bhai Thamen!!!! go somewhere where you would eat something peacefully on sheshri unlike for being hassel by the whole environment! and one more my personal opanion( their food aint that much especial as I thought it would be its just  like other bangali restaurants like Baburchi and Star kabab.) Sorry for the Al Razzak's fans  to break your hearts into pieces \nbut I coudnt help myself to breakout the truth of it.",

  "Review 2: Six Seasons Hotel ifter and dinner buffet. Well good food and not so many items but good enough to fill in. and specially some of the dishes are too good that I just avoided other ones. Ifter items were less & mostly dinner items. regular piyaju, beguni, aloor chop,chola for ifter items and date, muri was already on table. I didnt try much of ifter items. Lemon juice was fine and lassi - i didnt like it at all. Their lasagna is outstanding and must have if you go there. I will just name the good dishes: dumplings, beef teppayanki, lasagna, another beef curry I forgot the name and also the sushi. pasta, rice and tandoori chicken was okayish nothing extra ordinary. There was also naan, noodles, some chicken curry i didnt taste so cannot name them sorry. They got live chicken/beef Teppanyaki + sushi bar. sorry couldnt take picture of live chicken/beef Teppanyaki since the place was always crowded and people standing to take it but it was awesome and you must have it if you go there. desserts were good. chocolate ball, jello and baklava were nice. rest i didnt try but there was around 15 dishes for dessert i guess including fruits. overall good and nice view from 13th floor if your table is near window. 1599+ per person but if you have brac bank gold card it  buy one get one free so it will be 1000 tk person for that.",

  "I had Iftar at Nando's(Dhanmondi 27) yesterday, 23rd July 2014. When I got out, half way to Shimanto Square, I realized to have left my iPhone 5 on the table in a hurry and went back to Nando's within hardly 10 minutes. The phone was gone. When I left my phone and was getting out, a waitress was cleaning our table. But when asked she replied to have taken only the glasses and a waiter showed up to mention that he was the one who cleaned the entire table and haven't found anything on it. Their behavior seemed very fishy, but as it was my own fault forgetting the phone out there carelessly, I was helpless. Although the manager was helpful and gave his number to inform us. He checked the washrooms and everywhere possible. Later calling an acquaintance for help, I got to know that this kind of incident happened before at Nando's and the phones were found hidden inside the washrooms after searching via ringtones. Unfortunately anyone can turn iPhones silent instantly. It was ringing at the first 5 times I tried calling. Later was turned off. Dhamondi Nando's don't have CCTV camera inside the place where I sat.\n\nThere was a couple sitting right next to our table when we got out. I'm basically writing here hoping they'd see this and try to help. Or anyone who were present there, if they have noticed the incident of taking the phone from the table. Please help me back.\n\nI am not pointing my finger at Nando's as many people thought and wanted to start an argument without understanding my words properly. Restaurants are run by/with people. And its heart wrecking to reveal and realizing the truth about some people in our own country. I don't mean any harm to anyone's feelings. Please spare me from any debate as I'm not in that mental state.\n\nI have already filed a report at Dhanmondi Model Thana with the IMEI number. But if anyone can help me get it faster. It will be appreciable.",

They served Iftar platter 10 min late for 8 persons where we were 12 in number. And some items were missing. After 25 min they informed us that they can not provide remaining 4 platters! Oh, they arranged our table in veranda! And didn't informed us. I was stunned that manager was giving excuse that even he didn't manage to take Iftar! Even they don't have enough plates, they gave 3 plates of rice to share 12 person. I don't know about food as I got dates and a glass of lemonade only. The food is not good according to my friends. It is far more better to take Iftar at masque which will cost nothing.",

  "Today I went to BBQ Tonite for iftar with a friend. We ordered Half chicken chargha and half beef lahori along with naan and romali roti. The food tasted really good without any big faults, just that there were small sharp bones in the beef lahori which sometimes put us into trouble and there were also some chunk of pure fat without any meat at all in them. So they would get a 7/10 for the food quality and quantity. Coming to the service part, I would say they lack greatly. We were served with the roti 20 minutes before iftar so it became kinda cold and they served us with water 5 minutes after azaaan. We could hardly gain the attention of the waiters, all they did was shifting the responsibility to each other. Not helpful at all. So they get a 2/10 for service. And coming to the price part I would say it is quite acceptable except for the fact that they charged around 100 taka more for a half plate meal than the original half price. Even they charged for a normal table salad with 4 pieces of cucumber, onion and carrot which is complimentary in most of the restaurants :/ So here they would get a 6/10. \nOverally I would give them 6.5/10 comparing everything :) \n*sorry for the bad image quality due to lens prob :)",

And predictably, it was full to the brim. However, the staff at Kiva Han were gracious enough to accommodate  the two of us by pulling up a small table and two chairs. They could probably tell that we were very much in need for seats (with iftar being 15 minutes away) and did their very best to make room for us somehow. So, thank you Kiva Han for enabling us to have iftar on time today! :)\n\nThe set menu was filling and the red velvet cake served as dessert was rich and tasty!",

The platter consisted of a barbeque chicken, 2 pieces of fried fish fillets, mashed potato, 2 small pieces of sandwich made with chicken and pineapple,  a little salad and a cup of chicken hakkah noodles. Overall it wasn't a very bad experience. The noodles tasted good as well as the mashed potato, and the barbeque chicken and the sandwiches were somewhat okay, not mindblowing. But the fish fillets had a weird smell probably the fish was a smelly one. It wasn't good at all. Food wasn't amazing but won't say im utterly disappointed.  Would rate it 6 on 10 TBVH :/",

  "TO ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR IFTAR OUTINGS:\n If you are thinking about having an iftar buffet at Kabab Factory, then you are probably making the greatest mistake in your entire life. You would rather want that precious 600tk of your's to have donated to a fokir or spend on anything else but definitely not waste on that food. \n\nThe items you will get in the set menu are piaju, chicken toast, dates, muri, samosa, fruit salad, vegetable pakora, jhali kabab, chana masala and a small bowl of halim with one small piece of beef. Lemonade (which is actually typical lebur shorbot) Rose milk (which is Rooh afza blended with badam er shorbot) and Rooh Afza itself are the drinks that they serve. \n\nNow you may be thinking that it‚Äôs a long list of items but when you look at your plate with filled with everything, it‚Äôs mainly those everyday items that your mom makes at iftar. Sadly, you won‚Äôt get most of the items if you go there 30mins before the iftar.\n\n With that hunger inside you right before the iftar, when you are craving for something that would fulfill your appetite, you take your first bite and you would wish that it was your last. You will definitely want to forget the fact that you had an iftar today. The food is so cold and hard you will have to tear it hard with your canines.\n\n Despite experiencing all those hardships of life for about half an hour you WILL have to pay 600Tk. That is when your 600tk becomes the most precious 600Tk of your life and then you have nothing to do rather than walk away with absolute desolation and repentance.",

I had the enchilada at the end and the yummy cheesy enchilada made me greedy, so I ordered another enchilada. I didn't realize that they gave two enchiladas on one order, and when it came, my mom gave up and said she wouldn't have anymore. Finally I persuaded her and we split them and ate them. Now we feel sick and bloated because we ate too much, but it was absolutely worth it!

  "Iftar platter at Ecstasy Caffe in JFP. Rate- 4/10\n\nThe mango juice was not nearly thick enough, the soup might as well have been water. The veggies were too crunchy, the couscous tasted funny, the chicken was kinda dry, the shwarma was cold, and the fruits were like fruits. Everything was served in weak portions, and the pie was sliced paper thin. It had an okay filling that tasted too floury, but the crust of the pie, was wonderfully crunchy and still crumbly. Overall, definitely not something I'd pay over 350 for. And to think they charged us 700. :@\n\nI think I'd rather have two plates of fuchka/chotpoti and a double scoop of Ferrero Rocher ice-cream from Club Gelato at HALF the price.",

  "Review No - 04\n\n:: The Backyard Chef ::\n\nLocated in uttara, Rabindra sarani, Sector-3. newly established and well decorated. I called them for reservation and almost got rejected but thank god they accept my reservation. Felt like seeking a job over phone. \n\nIt was more embarrassing when I came to the restaurant. I reserved for 3 person and they provided me a table for two where barely two people can put their plates. we adjusted like others do but it's not acceptable in a restaurant. owners should spend more to improve service rather making fancy designs. \n\nThey arranged like 70-80 people in a relatively small place and their air-conditioning system was not working properly. I was sweating before iftar and when I stand for the queue I was more disappointed. it's not a proper restaurant for buffet. There should be a speculative space for standing in a line, a hidden in and exit way. All were missing. With the table space they probably can't arrange a buffet with 30+ items. \n\nFood: it's a cheap buffet(450+tk) so couldn't expect more items. And there weren't more then 20 items. full of iftari items like peyaju, beguni, vegetable pakora, bread, roll, jilapi, 3 types of salad, khejur, chola. Found only 3 dinner items and two of them were rice and magi noodles. Over phone they told me about mejbani beef and chicken fry or curry item but here I couldn't  find any chicken item except some wasted chicken stuff fried with some unknown supplies. Good things first; only the pudding cake was good. 2nd good thing was the haleem. Rest are rubbish. Mejbani gost was hard, Polao rice was old and smelly; in fact full time I smelt something which was coming from someones socks. Their toilet was clean and I'll only visit here if I have to pee.

The portion of chicken is enough to fill your tummy. If you are taking the meal then you can add a side dish too. It comes with a salad. The side dish options are- pomme frutes, mashed potato, steamed rice, tornado potato and fried rice. You can order any one of them. In this picture i ordered their mashed potato. They serve two pieces of chicken in the meal.\n\n2- Blue curaoko: i really dont remember the name of the drink but its something similar to this. Its a fizzy drink and it tasted really good and refreshing. They have other flavors too. The small jar of drink is enough for two persons. \nCost- 1224 bdt for two persons.

After talking to the owner, I was suggested to try the \"Red Velvet Cupcakes\" as it is their best selling product. So I decided to listen to their advice and I ordered some of these special cupcakes. I was not disappointed AT ALL. These cupcakes were probably the best red velvets I ever tasted :O Most other ones are too cakey and too spongey, and the taste of the cupcakes are very bland. However, THESE cupcakes were really heavy and smack full of taste. And the cream cheese topping on top was so smooth and practically perfect. BESIDES all that, the cupcakes looked absolutely delectable and I will definitely be ordering from them very very often. Sometimes, they even have discount offers going on, so check out their page and show them some love! Trust me, they deserve it :)\n\nCupcakes & Co. - My choice for one of the best online pastry shops :)",

We loaded up on the cake before it was finished and bugger turned out they just had that one cake.

It had no tandoori chicken and rice instead of the naan. For both the platters u have Ur choice of either the chicken curry or beef curry, butter dal and vegetables. I should have rather ordered the rice thali cause the tandoori was very dry and salty. There was no balance of flavors and it wasn't exciting at all.  Its better to order the rice thali and ask for the extra nan.  After u add the service charge and tax, it really becomes expensive compared to what u get. I wish Handi  offered Sehri. Then I would have never gone here. I am not going back to tarka for sehri again but to be fair their beef curry tasted much better than the tandoori.",

Then I request you to think about all the coming iftar invitations marked on your calender to be held in exotic places, with your good buddies; look at all those invitations that promises to take good care of your gourmet. Then you plan. I am not suggesting you to take guilt on the fact that you may have to feast.\nI say if you see a feast filled, festive Ramadan marked ahead of you, then you probably belong to the group of people who can serve feasts in even more festive scale to the needy group of the society.\nPlan the feasts you are going to offer for those people too, mark your days when you shall serve too.

  "So I had the '5 Napkin Burger' from Smoke Music Cafe today.\nI've never done a 'food review' before ... so here goes.\nThe Look - It looked great. I opened the box and the whole big cheesy look of the burger drew me in.\nThe Smell - It smelled great. The meat smell, the cheese and the pickle smells were all nicely blended. Nothing overwhelming.\nThe Taste - Now this is where I have a bit of a problem. It was good but not 'great' . Its technically a very fine burger. The patty is juicy not dry. Its cheesy but not salty. There's pickles but not too many. Yet the taste for some reason didn't feel very flavourful if you know what I mean.\nPrice - I'd say worth it at 385 Tk. After all ... this isn't something you're going to have every week. But every two week or those random burger cravings. This is definitely a filler.\n\nOVERALL - A solid 7.5 / 10 for me. I'd definitely take my friends to have it and I'm sure I'll have it again in 2 or 3 weeks. It didn't 'wow' me but it was good and filling. :)",

There were also beef bacon pieces in the burger, but nevertheless it tasted like the american burger.\nAs for the tato-stix, it was bitter, and had the same feeling as having \"alur chips\" sold in the mudir dokans in plastic bags. Except that the mudir dokans' ones are much better and cheaper -__-\n\nNext went to the next door neighbour, Papa Roti to kill sometime as we had ordered take-away chowmein from Preetom.

Here's what I personally feel are the three WORST places you can go eat today in Dhaka.\n\n1) RASTA JERK Chicken   What was supposed to be Jamaican Jerk   \n                                          Chicken actually tastes more like biye baarir \n                                          baashi murgir roast, and their \"rice\" looks like it \n                                          has rat-poo in it. RASTA-r quality pura.\n\n2) Panini              -             The taste of their food, by NO means, justifies  \n                                           their sky-high price. The ultimate rip-off place \n                                           in dhaka right now with below standard food.\n\n3) HAKASA           -             Trust me, ANY other place selling noodle right now \n                                           is probably more satisfying than Hakasa. Some \n                                           of their noodle items are uncomfortably spicy, \n                                           while the others just taste bad.. reeaalllyyy \n                                           BAD.

  "A little review of the dinner tonight at Mozzaria! It's a new place, loved the decor..very classy, spacious and beautiful lighting. As for the food- Huge portions and amazing taste, the chicken parmesan and the chicken cacciatore was superb! These dishes come with two sides of your choice. We took Curly fries, Sauteed veg and pasta salad. Was dissapointed with the portions of the sides though..but probably the best veg and salad i have come across till now..laced with the perfect amount of butter and seasoning, i could have eaten a bowl of that alone. The bread and butter was complimentary. \n\nPrice: 900/- each for the dishes. \nPrice range: Affordable within 1 to 2k. Almost all items range within 2k and 1500 taka. \nDisliked: Wanted more of that side veg. :P and the chicken dishes are too powerful to the taste to be eaten alone..needs more increased quantity of sides to compliment.\n\nWould defo go back to try more! Great for dates and family dinners as well. \n\nCheers!",

Rather than completely dismissing a dish or restaurant by saying its the best or worst, try justifying what you liked or disliked about the dish you had. E.g I didnt like this burger cos there wasnt enough cheese, rather than 'oh not going there, theyre the worst'. This gives a more constructive review and helps all restaurant owners in this group to take on the feedback and work on it. Hope we can build on what we have here and make the group better at every step. And please give us any feedback at any time.

The beef burger patty of theirs is outstanding. I am actually surprised how well some other carts are doing with the most generic of patties, using ketchup/mayo and what not to compensate for the bland taste. Take Hotbox for example, they are set-up right next to Burger Shack. I tried their burger the other day, and was left quite disappointed. Terrible patty, drowned in sauce (i guess that's what they count on for flavor), the bun was stale, there were crumbs falling off from my first touch :S Hotbox does have a point though, their burgers cost only 100tk whereas WOW, Awesome, or BurgerShack burgers are priced higher, But if you are to sell a burger this bad, might as well sell it for 50? :S\n\nEnough about carts though, if you want the restaurant experience and enjoy a burger,and are willing to play a bit more :P, Preetom will not disappoint! \nAbsolutely Fantastic!",

  "Honest Review:\nWent to BIbi Biriyani for lunch today. Heard a lot about this place. Biriyani(Beef) was good enough at least worth of trying. But you have to pay extra for every single thing it's like the way we pay for different topping for pizza or burger. Even you have to order your salad differently and they will serve it in mini size poly bags that was weirdest thing I ever saw at any restaurant. Their Famous Gulab Jamun was the worst thing Trust me when I'm saying this.
