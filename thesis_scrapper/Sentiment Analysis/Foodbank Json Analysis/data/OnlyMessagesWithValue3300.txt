Friday's - I really like their tangy chicken. It's big enough to be shared by 2 people but you may have to order an extra rice as it doesn't come with any. (8.5/10)\n2. Subfactory - I am not a big fan of sandwiches but this place does have good ones. (8/10)\n3. Poplar - I find all their desserts too sweet for my liking but others seem to really enjoy them. I only like their milk pudding. (7/10)\n4. Ecstasy Caffe -I ordered a grilled chicken meal which  tasted good & was quite filling but it is a lil overpriced & the portions of other dishes are very small (7/10)\n5. Urban spice - I went there with my family & had a very good meal. Their Tom yum soup had huge prawns & every single thing we ordered was very good (Thai fried rice, steamed lemon fish, some beef & chicken dish I can't remember the name of) but I've heard of other people having bad experiences which tells me their sservice isn't consistent (for me - 9/10)\n6. Bnb - love their chicken teriyaki burger (9/10) \n7. Tekiya - I had the shrimp sushi & liked it but again ice hears mixed reviews of this place (for me - 8/10)\n8. Khushbu - the yoghurt sorbet is very good but ask them not to add lemon to it (8/10)\n9. Tabaq - liked their CB the first time but not so much the 2nd time but love their ferrero rocher shake.(8.5/10)\n10. Happy bites - l liked their Oreo shake way better than tabaqs but I went there a long time ago & my sister went there recently & said that it sucked ( for me - a 9/10)\nThat's all for now ^_^","Value":2},{"Message":"Chocolate Banana Snow ice !!!\nIt tastes too good\nI would rate it 10/10","Value":2},{"Message":"My second visit to Hong Kong style cafe at jfp.\nChicken and mushroom wonton soup it is! :) \nPrice - around 200taka","Value":1},{"Message":"#COLD_COFFEE\n#LEMONADE","Value":1},{"Message":"For lovable people.....\n\nSource : T'morrows'\nPrice : 1900/- per kg\nFlavor : Darkchocomoist with butter cream nd Choco drops\nWeight : 2.5 kg\nhttps://m.facebook.com/Tmorrows","Value":1},{"Message":"newmarket,elephant road, dhanmoni 2;3;4;5;6 er moddhe ki kono valo khabarer jayga ase? plz let me know","Value":0},{"Message":"popeys cold coffee khilgaon er exact location ta plzzzz kau janan????","Value":0},{"Message":"Nothing irrelevant, hope it helps. :) Food safety measures.
